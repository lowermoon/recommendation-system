It's such a good game to play with friends ( I can't really recommend it without them). The mechanics are not the easiest to learn and there will be times when a team comes and just destroys you but believe me it makes the game more fun.The soundtrack of is good and it gives rhythm to the game and even though I usually don't listen to this type of games I can enjoy it while playing.The graphics of the game are good normal I would say they are not jaw dropping but neither unplayable.The microtransactions are there but they don't really influence the game maybe there are a few cars with better hit boxes but the difference won't mean much on a lower level.I can't really find any cons so I'm going to give a 9/10 ( it just needs a little bit more to become a perfect Game).\n","-----\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Ambil data yang akan digunakan untuk pengujian\n","test_project_index = 10  # Misalnya, mengambil salah satu proyek sebagai \"data uji\""],"metadata":{"id":"herS06J1ntjy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Ambil data proyek uji dari tfidf_matrix\n","test_project_data = tfidf_matrix[test_project_index]\n","test_project_data = test_project_data.reshape(1, -1)  # Reshape data ke bentuk yang sesuai"],"metadata":{"id":"Fw1_pdT3olCx"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Hitung kesamaan kosinus antara proyek uji dan proyek lainnya\n","similarities_to_test = cosine_similarity(test_project_data, tfidf_matrix)"],"metadata":{"id":"O4HTNnKrnyv9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Ambil beberapa proyek teratas (kecuali dirinya sendiri) sebagai rekomendasi\n","top_similar_projects = similarities_to_test.argsort()[0][-6:-1][::-1]"],"metadata":{"id":"tSsS1qW8nyyp"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Tampilkan rekomendasi\n","for index in top_similar_projects:\n","    print(f\"Nama Proyek: {project_names[index]}\")\n","    print(f\"Deskripsi: {project_descriptions[index]}\")\n","    print(\"-----\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"m1ByEAZen2AD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1702914995177,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":605,"user":{"displayName":"Ramadhania Humaira","userId":"10949617200977367926"}},"outputId":"8df3885f-ea49-4b2d-f9bc-05f0ce2390a6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Nama Proyek: joki Bang Bang\n","Deskripsi: Product received for free.
