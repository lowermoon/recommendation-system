Product received for free. Very Nice
Best game i have ever played until Red Dead Redemption 2 came out. 10/10 no doubt
A very fun and unique premise. Surprisingly competitive.
rather get cancer
Pretty solid game. Price point is really affordable fun mechanics big vareity of guns and alot of combat with a downside of some bugs. Would give a solid 4/5
Es un juego que te volves adicto cuando sovrevivis tu primer juego.Me paso que lo baje en la semana que estaba gratis y lo desinstale.Cambie de parecer y lo volvi a bajar y ahi me atrapo es un juego que hay que darle una hora para que te atrape.
Product received for free. Just buy the game if you have a bad graphics card put the resolution at 1600x900 and your graphics settings on fast. It runs like a champ.
ing Sucks!
good
nıce game
I love this game on the phone but on the computer THE GAME SUCKS!!!!! On the phone your minimap indicates to where the direction of sound is coming from. on computer THERE IS NO INDICATION! I hear a gunshot then I am looking everywhere trying to see where the hell it came from just to get shot again! is it a joke or am I the only one to notice this? Good God this is an irritating haddicap! I ususually get at least 2(3 to 4 on good days) kills a game and always end up in the top 10%. on computer I have had the game running just a few days with its beutifull graphics and physics I have been nothing but a friggin target. Screw this peice of S #!
Bought it when it was in Legacy. I like getting killed by naked men with spears it was my dream.
The trailer is complete t the moment I spawned I got gangbanged by six nakeds teamed up and I died... By torches.
The most advanced PC game GTA 5 is a 64 bit game DX11 4K multi threaded multi core it has the biggest map the most vehicles a lot of guns a lot of missions high quality The best game of 2015
Great game great graphics and gameplay... A few griefers on online other than that its a lot of grinding and greatTotally Reccomend this game
没使用外挂还能封号还玩什么

Haven't touched GTA in a while but still had it installed soon changed after I saw what your company was doing to people that helped boost your sales in free advertisement. Suppose that kind of thing doesn't matter now though uninstalled and won't be playing on any platform until you remove your heads from your asses.

ye it good
Grand theft auto 5 is a thoroughly enjoyable game for all ages (&gt 18 )) with plenty to see and do no matter your tastes and vast intricate cityscapes to explore. while minor problems do occur and of course you can encouter plenty of bugs (as i can say i have had my fair share of) for a game of its size in terms of maps this is expected and is normally resolved quickly.i certainly recommend it.
Laggy when playing in EU which is the only region that a queue actually pops in. Sat for 15 minutes in NA queue with nothing during prime time. Sad.
It's just AWESOME!!! We did it we waited.
0/10 i want to have in game sex with ben.
it's
Although this game was amazing playing it on a budget laptop during a trip was not the best way to experience it. I have already refunded the game on Steam but overall it was a great experience. It even has 4 player split screen so i could play with my roadtrip buddies! Also it works in multi platform so you can play with people who are on ps4 aswell. If it were a little less graphical heavy this game is a total 10/10
Good game
it's good.
not BaD
good
"You know why this review is negative.Do not buy this game until Take2 learns their lesson and ""legalizes"" modding again."

"RUST ""Yes you have to remember to eat in real life also""."
A game for the true massochist who between crashes and lag spikes enjoys dying approximately ever 5 minutes. Overall it's a highly recommended game that I would urge anyone to get.
Pretty neato game if i do say so myself
I've only had a couple sessions with this game so far but I've been a bystander for a while and would still like to voice my opinion on this game which I don't do a lot. Not on Steam anyways.I can't recommend this game to anyone even if you plan to play with friends. It's only fun for maybe an hour or two. It's buggy and unpolished from the developers overall laziness and greed. Maybe if they were to pull their head out of their own bum and see the major issues with this game and why another game similar is doing so much better and overall is a better game. I got it as a gift from a friend and I'm glad I did so because it wasn't going to get a cent of my money.
This game is great. Its easy to pick up but difficult to master so it keeps you coming back to play more.
Not all chinese are cheaters but have to admit lots of cheaters are chinese i m a chinese player i also have many foreign friends many times me and my teammates were killed by cheaters i dont want to see thoso guys destory this game maybe region lock China is a right solution.Anyway NOT ALL CHINESE ARE CHEATERS please be friendly to a chinese player if he is not a cheater thank you.#Region Lock China
great game ).
"With the latest Openiv ban i think this game Online wise will get bettersingle player. well boring.Update with recent proceedingspeople believe their ing has changed take two's mind even though there we're legal processes that took place and they came toa solution of ceasing the mod that caused this drama ""porting liberty city into GTAV""funny how the internet works people think gave devs will look at their client and listen if they'd do that they make single player dlc non hyper expensive dlc items aswell as fixing the biggest problem they've had for years.gotta love the internet."
Game is pretty good not very scary but suspenseful. Would reccomend 9/10. Some killers and players are fat and meanies and still some small bugs.
Awesome
THIS GAMES SICK WOULD RECOMMEND
IN GOOD
Holy 600h already?Buy it.10/10
It's allright I guess. Played it twice. Quite fun.
game constantly crashing when joining a lobby and starting game ever since latest update/patch was released
Rockstar can suck my absolutely no support for those who cannot play the game because of their perma link to steam accounts... so if you bought the game on a different account not activated to steam rockstar will take outs its big willy and shuv it down your throat and make you wait 1 month to answer a ticket that will probably not help. Because giving the power of unlinking your steam account to the customer is too much to handle and would give them a god complex. YOU ruined my day/week.
Product received for free. I got this game with my GTX 1050 ti and I didn't really expect much to be honest. Turns out if you have friends to play with it's actually a really fun game! One of the best local multiplayer games on PC. If you have friends definitely try it out!
10 out of 10Would die over and over again.
GG
Awesome
Recommended if you have the time.
It's a really good game! Recomand!
this is a fun game to enjoy by your self or with friends
Good and interesting game but still no fix for game
THANKS DEV.. GARBAGE OPTIMIZE THE GAME...FAIL ....
.
Game is crashing constently and by that time blue line is killing me .. WTF is game ? Most played game of 2017 ? i dont recommend this bull sht now ! Servers are busy and we will be kicked in between matches ! GGWP
You gotta check out this gaem good memes
A game that is more fifa than fifa!
Product received for free. This game is so fun please play and kill me.
make sure you ask for a headcount of Chinese hackers when you enter a lobby
Rocket League is a fun and exciting game and is definitly more enjoyable with friends. only bad thing is that they dont realease more free stuff to unlock much. so you can unlock everything really quickly which sucks as it is fun unlocking more and more stuff as you go. And you cant play cross platform in a private match aswell (Which Sucks) definitly worth the money 8/10
This game gorgeous!GOTY (2013 Next GTA release)
pc
A great game even though it is still in early access. But at this moment some players are already cheating hope the devs make solution about it or else it will be the reason some player getting bored again playing this game.
Too much hackers after the sanhok patch.Edit They Have fixed the hacker issue on a pretty good way after the BattleEye notice popped up. GJ!
"GTA V Multiplayer Review + good graphics + good performance + nice missions and ""quests"" + makes a lot of fun with friends + easy to reach 100+ hours 'cause it's fun + DLC's cars and clothings are too expencive got perma banned because I played with NO mods and hacks #rofl too much hacker and modder game nearly unplayable (they teleport you or even kill you)"
great game hard to get good at but fun
Online portion is bad single player portion is now bad as well. There's not enough content to justify buying this game. Mods could've improved that but as of now modding this game is not adviced.7/10 worst game ever.
awesome game
game full of tpeople with beast pc have advantage
Very good game and I would definitely recommend. Better with friends though.
I know 20 hours isn't a lot but it's enough to get the base of the game down. Pros Great GameplayGreat mechanicsAmazing GraphicsQuality loot mechanicAmazing way of getting health back. Cons You could be sitting there in a field drinking an energy drink and get shot in the headSo many people thirdperson peak corners causing the gameplay to be a little bit upsetting but there's a FPP (First Person Perspective) mode for Solo Duo and Squads which counters that point. And yeah. I don't have much experience but it'd be great if someone could hmu that plays this game a ton and could teach me some things. &lt 3

Great games
Ein echt tolles Spiel ! Ja die Bugs sind nervig aber manchmal auch echt witzig Es macht supper viel Spaß wenn man mit seinen Freunden spielt Insofern man welche hat #solonely Es ist ein Shooter wofür man auch Taktik brauch was ich cool finde aber nicht so viel Taktik wie bei Arma das ist meiner Meinung nach übertirben
Просто космос
"""10/10"" IGN"
used to be one of the greatest online experiences I ever had turned into a hackfest with absolute brainless grind to get anything past vanilla content.story mode/offline play still a masterpiece thoughedit since take two and rockstar decided to ban players and prohibit ANY MOD in the OFFLINE play this game turned into utter
This game is getting worst with each update parachute is absolutely still filled with bugs overall its still not recommanding
pls add some kind of party mechanism that allows your friends to see that its actually you
Gets boring really fast
Rust Paintings Weapons Raids Building Fun and more.
very buen game 10/10 IGNWoWNot bugNot visual bugNot connexion errorNot bad quality of viewGud Giem
Rocket League ist ein spiel was es verdinnt hat in denn steam charts auf Platz 1 zu sein
Rockstar has ended on gta iv Can't make good game no more Can't admit that the modders are doing better job than a few million worth company Your security services are a joke and servers are worse than EA GO HOME ROCKSTAR YOU'RE DRUNK
Banned for using profanity? Why not just mute me you stupid
everyone is still better than me!
The new updated version of rust is looking really cool the only downfall is it is 100% un playable. The fps lag is ridicuous.
great games even better with friends. but be weary of the moders though some of them are nice.
It's a real rumpus.
When it's done. It'll be greait.
Awesome to play with a squad of friends. Mouse controls are not as solid and smooth as say the CoD and Battlefield series. Gameplay is great. Graphics are not the best but it looks decent. Replayability is great considering this is a competitive game but the actual content is actually few and far between.Recently can't play it without using VPN. I hear a lot of people on same ISP (Sky Cable) having the same issue.Uninstalled it. Currently playing BFV which is a lot more fun IMO.
gssgsfsgsgsgsgsg
"It aint optimized for my system... ""What is the current state of the Early Access version?'The game is stable'"" Well... I gave it some time and I gotta say! It runs like a charm now! Solid 50 fps (On low settings XD) Now being able to properly play PUBG I can say its safe to say that this has a special ""feel"" to it. It's almost like a horror game that you pour hours into and when you end up dying in the end of it all you litterally scream in terror. I love this game. I take back what I said.Dear Blue or whatever your name is Just dont't up the game anymore... The optimization works NOW... _"
THIS GAME IS NOT PLAYABLE (AT LEAST NOW)1. LOT OF BUGS AND LAGSall players are lagging from 30 shots u will barely hit target 2 times (not joking)Freezes even with my 6700k 4.5ghz processor and SLI GTX10802. GAME JUST ENDSWhile i was runnig ingame i was thrown to a main menu. WHY? IDK3. GRAPHICS are so so render distance is very tinyI have a H1Z1 KOTK game which is much more fun to playTo sum up avoid buying this game for few month and maybe it will become more playable but not now
Oh man. This game really has its ups and downs. The community is trash and you always get killed on sight. Very few people are actually friendly outright and most are constantly skeptical. But something about the constant bickering is endearing. This game has a lot of heart and has certainly come a long way since a year ago. The dev team for this game are easily the most dedicated Early Access devs I've ever seen. Bi weekly content updates listening to the community about bugs/greivances and solid game design. This is the holy trinity and they nail it. My only critique would be the lack of PvE elements trying to kill you. Sure the thudding of a bear can be terrifying if you aren't prepared to fight it but its not enough. Players need something to be scared of other than each other so that more focus can go to the environment. Lastly removing visibility during the night was an interesting move but it makes half the time spent in game almost useless without using a light source. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but it would be nice if we could have night vision goggles as a super rare drop/craft. Might be asking for too much but it would certainly help.Anyway excellent game. 9/10. Definitely worth the money.
My friends played this for nearly a year before I decided to try it which I shouldve done much earlier. It's a very skillbased game where you can easily sht on others or get sht on. Lot of smurfing involved of course as in other games but this is extremely satisfying fast and chill to play. I can basically play this all day almost. Think I already have like 1200 hours. Great game with an insane value for most. If you tend to suck at games this is maybe not for you.
GTA 5 is a great game dont get me wrong but it takes a really good pc to use I myself have a i7 12 gigs of ram 750ti (low end 1050ti) and I can only cap 30 frams on all the lowest settings if they fixed this it would have been a postive review but I cant even play the game.
这个游戏开启了新的打法 队友之间的配合 默契 战术 留下感动 真的很爱这款游戏
really fun game hacking is bad sum times but meh still love it to bits 10/10
Do not buy this game. Absolutely horrible graphics. No tutorial whatsoever. Don't expect to be treated with respect as a sole player you will be killed. Even if you get as far as building a house it will be raided. Stay away do not buy. If you like survival games try dayz (stand alone version on steam) or Arma 3 + zoombies mod.
bought this game twice it was totally worth it. game runs perfectly when in singleplayer but in online game has few connection issues.
Good game. Simplicity is it's strength. I cannot support any game which one pays full price in beta and then they start to roll out microtransactions. It's very disingenuous of a publisher to say it's a one time thing to pay for a competition and they need the money when a small team has made over 100M gross. Say no to microtransactions from the start otherwise every aspect of the game will be monetised. We start with cosmetic skins for a one time event in summer 2017 summer 2018 we'll have paid drops which only contain top tier weapons and specials.Say no to monetisation and microtransactions from the start. Do not support this game.
game apaan nih? tapi kok enak ya?
Great Game
Great game somthing different
I don't like soccer. I don't like racing games. But I love rocket league
Welcome to Po i !
This game is upright trash don't even bother to spend your money in 2018 there's so much more options if you wish to invest to spend your money and or time in BR game. The only thing i wish is that I could get back my 300hours and life back along with money!
Fluck this game. The multiplayers tight and fun as hell. The naked men is grosssssssssssssss their we wees are far to large for them and frankly I feel insulted that you have these men hung like gods parading around me as I pawn their asses with my gun. Also I think hats should be implimented. Played this with my two steam friends and I pawned their buts off. They were first time players and I showed them that life aint fair by shootin thems faces cleans offs. They got and started baradding me with insults and unfriended me. Dont care though I didnt even want any friends on steam
bad servers lots of lag even getting disconnected because of time out while having no internet problems what so ever
Game is great. Mods make it better. F off you have enough moneys
If adding new cosmetics and fixing the millionth bugs that shouldn't been there in the first place called content then no thanks.
its sueing fornite
very good game
More u play more u enjoy. Many characters special unique perks great sountrack coop enjoyable gameplay
There s nothing new I can say that hasn t been said about this amazing installment in the Resident Evil series. I am a huge fan of the original RE2 and this game exceeded my expectations. The environment alone was enough to creep me out. The zombie sounds and models are terrifying and damn Mr. X is here only to give heart attacks. All in all I give this game a 10/10 and I can t wait to see if Capcom can do RE3 and Code Veronica X the same amount of Justice this remake has made for a classic and timeless game. Heck I wouldn t mind a RE1 and RE0 remake now made similar to 2!
my memes got stolen help
Great game highly addictive cant complain considering it is not a finished product. Would reccomend!
Thumbs up! Exciting one. To be honest didn't believe that this masterpiece will seize for a long time. The game had a lot of problems on the start. BUT! Now its perfect nothing to say about an optimization shooting or transport. It just works and I'm satisfied.
It's fun but money is harder to get nowadays
Pros It's a gameIt's not a full price game at 30CAD.ConsBoring after a few hours.Microtransactions for lootboxes and the items look like atleast its cosmetic only.3 maps all equally boring after the second time.Servers are pretty bad every other game such as TF2 or CS GO run fine this one doesn't.Hitboxes are questionable at least. Registration for hits seems to lag behind severely.Janky movement definitely doesn't feel fluid.Feels slow you either tear people a new one or get hit by a sniper from god knows where.It was in early access when they added microtransactions even though this game was the most played steamgame.Looks and runs like garbage (Watch textures on your 2000$ system render before your eyes at 50FPS!) For reference this is on a 6 core Zen Processor and a GTX 1070 ti 16 gigs of ram too.This game just feels... off.
byeeeeeeeeee
I did not heed the bad reviews of this game and bought it and regretted it thoroughly. The game is so full of cheats and hackers. A simple search online (which I failed to do) would churn loads of cheat peddlars selling constantly updated cheats. Bottom line is if you really want to play this game be prepared to splurge on cheats as well otherwise you'd probably die a few mins in. If not DO NOT BUY IT! Just download Fortnite from Epic whom the PUBG developers are so busy suing instead of focusing on prolonging the lifespan of their own game.
Really good single player campaign but GTA Online is an exercise in frustration. It takes a very long time to load into a session and you are never automatically placed in a session with friends when starting the game.GTA Online is rife with hacking which usually means you die a lot to people that spawn the best weaponry or you get kicked from the game because you're being gifted cash or somehow killing everybody in the session instantly.If you can get a team of friends together the Heist missions in GTA Online are instanced so there's no way to be griefed there and you have an objective.Update Changing review to negative because the load times for GTA Online coupled with the cheating and Rockstar's attitude to both (ignoring it) is unacceptable.
Product received for free. Favorite this game
"Monster Hunter World is the latest iteration in the Monster Hunter series. I've played since Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate for the 3ds and have loved it since. If you enjoy killing monsters with lots of different weapons and weapon types try it out.+ Pros Just like any other Monster Hunter game before it. It has a wide variety of monsters to kill Weapons got an upgrade. Each weapon type now has something new with it (insect glaive can dash in the air dual blades has archdemon mode now etc.) Graphics got a BIG upgrade. No more PS2 looking graphics that's for sure. Never minded the graphics before but seeing this it brings a tear to my eye. Story got a buff. Like with Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate they added a tiny bit more to the story. Still the same general ""Elder Dragon X does stuff and we gotta stop it but there's more"" but it has more of a... depth? Length? One of those.+ Cons Initially came out with connection issues. Annoying to play with friends then get disconnected mid quest. It's since been fixed. There was a chance that killing the final main mission monster Xeno'Jiiva would corrput your save file during the credits. Make sure to make a backup beforehand! Teostra has some frame rate drops with his blast. Hopefully that gets fixed soon. Decoration RNG can be very unforgiving at times. When you just want one antipara and you get 8 antidote I die a little inside.All in all if you've played Monster Hunter before you will enjoy this game a lot. If you haven't give it a shot! If you like killing large monsters and lots of customization this game will suck you into a warm blanket of grinding with frustration that monster X just killed you because you FORGOT TO EAT AT THE CANTEEN FOR THE BUFFS!!!"
The game is fantastic BUT if you aren't sure your computer will run it don't risk. I could barely get 12 FPS on lowest settings when I can run CS GO with 100 FPS just fine.
This game is actually awesome
Rust Life baby.The game is fun as hell just don't cry and rage quit when people kill or raid you. That's Rust. Learn from it. I don't recommend learning how to play on a high pop public server. You can go play those when you want to throw yourself into the meatgrinder. The game is updated literally every week. Always new stuff.
NERF KILLERS GODDAMN
I. Can't. Stop. Sucking. 5/5!
Very awesome and addictive. It is one of the best battle royal games i have played and i know i will be spending lots of hours into this game. ) I recommend this to all people who love FPS games. Peace )
Do you like soccer? What about cars? What about rockets? If you answered yes to two of these things then guess what... FUN is abound. Rocket League combines the competitive nature of soccer the speed of rockets and cars into a simply elegant and yet wonderful game. The mechanics are wonderous the community is super chill and fun to play with and the gameplay can certain keep you entertained for hours upon hours. Simply said for those who don't get it.... BUY THIS GAME NOW! You will never regret it. And if you do... what the hell if wrong with you.10/10 Would shutdown enemy team again as dat goalie
This game is one of the most bugged games ever to come out i think BLUUHOLE SHOULD RENAME ITS STUDIO BLUEBALLS AND SHOULD GIVE EVERYONE REFUNDS ITS T AND THEY DONT FIX THE BUGS INSTEAD THEY ADD A LAGGIER VERSION OF THE GAME ONTO THERE TEST SERVER IT SO GAY DONT BUY AND IF U DID BUY IT ASK FOR REFUND GIVE A NEGATIVE REVIEW AND PLAY FORTNITE BLUEBALLS!!!!
Unplayable due to hackers the game is filled with the entire population of china. Otherwise fine.
Fun times await!In my opinion a casual game with a good learning curve. The learning curve adds good depth to the game. What amazes me more is how various other video games and brands online media publishers for video games etc have been included in the game in the form of car's visual additions. Flags etc. I can also wave my own country flag attached to my car. I love it!16/07/2018 If you are in India and are getting above 100 ping on all servers then turn your router ON and OFF. Do it a couple times till you get lower pings. This is a issue on your ISPs side assigning you to a zone in their network which just gives high pings all over accross most game you will ever play on the internet. I know this becuase I have had many times where I had low pings in the 60s as well for the same in game region. Go try it.
Best Gta game so far before Gta 6 is out btw..
I allways use the table dance a lot.Great game.
Awful performance and too much grind. When you get good stuff it is fun building up your base and raiding others but getting there takes far too long.
es gid
Big weapons and bigger monsters. What is not to love?

One of the best battle royal games
a real mans league.
much fun P
amazing
This is legit I love killing people in it
This is the most interesting game I've ever played the most junky server game and the most rampant plug in game I've ever played. It's broken me down.
cool
Worst game I've ever played the game crashes very often the graphics are terrible tons of hackers and most of the time you spend in this game is looting and it's not fun and the vehicle's are broken 0/10. Never recommend to anyone
the game is more dead than Mcskillet D
Amazing game Great fun. Little complicated to master. Overall a MUST BUY
If you don't have friends who play rust you probably shouldn't play rust. If you're a nice person you probably shouldn't play rust. If you don't have very much free time you probably shouldn't play rust (this game will actually take over your life it's crazy). If all three of those criteria were not met than you'll probably love this game.
haha great game check the steam charts
Best Ban Simulator of 2015!r8 8/8 m8.
This is honestly the worst game can be made but also a good game the worst thing about it its the coding there are a lot of code/ragdoll i guess you can call it that one tiny bump can flip your vihicle 720 degree yet somehow you can still land safely thats an awesome moment right there or even when you aimed for the enemy head sure its a missed yet ur next shot will be a instant kill with that over 100m distance awesome moment right there. worth of $30 you can still make money through this game with crates
There has been an error submitting this review.Please return to the dev studio and fix the game.
didnt play this game for a while came back and now it wont even start up a process crashes every time. great.
Now that i have 1k plus hours in this game i feel obliged to write a review Therefore i will try my best to describe what this game is at its core and why it is on a steep downward trend.I bought rust on June 17th 2016 And it was a really buggy and unfinsihed game but a really fun one it had alot of depth within the crafting and the pvp aspects. In my opinion xp was the best system for rust because it was a linear system in which one doesnt level up by being with a clan and having them do everything for them (like it is now) you had to actually farm and do things in the game that would contribute to your personal level And even if 1 person grinded really hard for 1 day they most likely would have rockets or c4 mabye ak but no raiding materials in which most of this game is dependant on that depth in raiding and pvp. And from that change from xp to components it wasnt about skill anymore it was about how much manpower you could muster and the chinese dominated this (for some reason i actually dont know why) in turn from that alot of those clans (in rust we call them zergs most of the time) they would cheat and from that more people feel inclined to cheat from that to counter them and from them countering the cheaters they kill more people and they feel inclined to cheat and the cycle repeats. And from that a toxic community forms not from social contact but from who can horde the most stuff and have the biggest base or the biggest zerg. The developers of this game are blissfully blind of what is actually happening in their game which is really saddening because rust used to be my favorite game of all time but this rapidly changed with the updates they have been releasing. These updates have the intentions of the people AWFULLY wrong and in turn the player base it turning against the company FacePunch studio's for not listening to the consumer feed back and doing whatever the they want with the game. A great expample of this is the boat update in this update they added boats in which you can go on the water and get items this is all fine and dandy but they have no clue what the community wants everyone on reddit has ben BEGGING for a change to pvp and the guns in the game. But no they want to add boats hot air balloons electricity and a lot of other t no one asked for. Which in turn made the community even more toxic and making everyone not trust facepunch. Which is making me turn my review against this game i give this game a 4/10 it is painfully average because facepunch has their fingers up their not changing what the entire community really wants in this game.Helk please
Last Patch Killed the game. No region lock so now you will send to any region like china o eu.i usually have 100 200 ms now i have 400 3000 ms and is full of Chung Hackers.dont waste ur life in this game with developers find a Gf or something.
Great game. Really fun. I recommend highly.
fazfz zf zf
It's like FIFA but better.
Fun Game. 10/10 ESports Ready
This game is obnoxious. Optimization of this game is just making me to puke. Gameplay is terrible after 30mins of looting yourself you will get killed from somewhere by camping mug. Just dont buy this game and dont support this disgusting company
The graphics are amazing and the concept is really creative but the Cars are a bit flimsy
Real life simulator at its best
Why would you play real sports when you can just play Rocket League right ? (please just end my suffering)
"Got shot because I accidentally said ""A n u s"" in the voice chat on a Christian server. 10/10 would be naked again."
A good game absolutely ruined by cheaters. Just play another battle royale until they fix this game.
It's fun to play with friends.
Epicly OP
This game is very poorly optimizedPlaying on a modern rig and getting 20 fps with settings on good worse on ultra.
best game ever
Great game and I hope take two rethink their policy.
Best walking simulator I've ever played. Unparalleled leg powering features. Sometime out of nowhere I get shot by somebody maybe that's a bug the devs could work on. Maybe the devs are going for a detroit vibe? Otherwise fantastic walking sim. One of the best out there if you can overlook the bugs.10/10 would get shot walking through a beautiful meadow again
spent 25 minutes finding weps and running around and trying to find people then get insta headshoted by a hacker from a few hundred meters. not even worth the 30$ price tag.
Best
Its complicated but good
Join the almighty Dwight empire today.
Much fun with many friends!
One of the best multiplayers games evr created imo
a pretty fun game to play solo but is better with a group of friends.edit erm like game ye haha
Skins? ...ok.Battle Pass? F*ck no. I paid. This isn't fortnite.Fix this sh*t.
gr8/8 with friends
This is honestly one of the best games I've played. It is super fun. I reccomend this to everybody despite there being a ton of glitches and things its actually really funny whenever a glitch happens and no they dont happen every single game or something but even if you are doing good and you die by a hilarious glitch It to me is more worth it. I'm not sure why this game is getting a lot of heat since it has amazing graphics and game play mechanics that I personally love but I definetly think it was worth the money.
I really love this game. I was watching it on Twitch for weeks before I ever bought it. I love survivor style games and competitive games so this fits a niche I've been trying to fill for quite some time. Right now there only seems to be 1 map with different weather effects but it is quite a huge map which makes it easily replayable. There is also supposed to be a new desert map coming which will be huge.
I absolutely recommend this game. But buyer beware at this point in time the anti cheat system is broke and you may revieve a ban for no reason. I'm not playing this again until I hear word its fixed. Thx
A little overhyped still fun though...
This game has come a long way from when i first played it. A lot of features have been added and taken away but it is now slowly starting to take shape for the better.I hope in future updates more AI will be available and that AI will actually do something.
well the dsync has gotten wores not sure what they are doing but i keep getting shot and killed though doors and walls windows trees watch the death cam and see bullets hitting and going thought all objects . block servers please # make PUNG GREAT AGAIN
iha OK
Many DLCs to play with
Great graphics and great gameplay. This game has a feeling like other games don't have. It has a story in singeplayer and mulitplayer that you can't get in other games. The singeplayer feel isn't boring and you will constantly want to keep on playing it while the multiplayer side is amazing and you will have lots of fun with the new updates that Rockstar is uploading constantly.
Addicted fam
Product received for free. It never connects to a game.Reservation Timed out ERROR 59 Error 59/10
awesome game and only getting better!
I love this game. Am I very good at in? No. Do i play against ppl who kick my all the time? Yes... But i love this game and cant reccomend it enough and for all the ppl who gave it negative reviews... Grow up... Get over the fact that you havent played as much as some ppl and dont bash it just because you suck... Are there cheaters? Yes. Is it better than fortnight? Different games. Cant really compare. But I think so.
It isn't very horror and it is a very good game if you are bored! I recommend it!
"As a fan of football (Soccer for all the people who are wrong) and cars this game is just the best dream come true.With nice graphics awesome physics the amount of customisation Rocket League is plainly manic fun especially with friends! If you don't have any buy this game anyway you loner!""A dream we all have had come real!"" 15/15"
"Gone from being something fun to an utter cash grab. Brand new cars with a 1 mph advantage over the previous one costs $30 to buy if bought with real cash. Rehashing and adding new game modes apprently the same game mode in 8 different locations counts as ""tons of new missions"". All the player made missions are either rubbish or just wall ride races around the same stretches of the city. The original missions and heists are fantastic but none more have been added since Online launched. The hacking is horrendous a few nice guys occasionally drop cash but most just grief and can actually crash your system.The game has horrendous network connectivity issues and issues with it not being hosted on servers clearly they didn't learn from GTA IV online.Overall a shame the charm humour and sociopolitical commentary of GTA games shines through but clearly the Rockstar bean counters want to wrangle cash from what could be a great game."
bad bug game always crash and give me error12
Simply stated this game is fun very fun. With countless things to do in both singleplayer and multiplayer GTA V has proven itself to be an abnormally enjoyable title that in not even two weeks I have managed to sink over 60 hours into. This is quite a large sum of time yet I am only 29% into the story mode and rank 38 in GTA Online. There is so much more to be done and I know this is a game that I have no regrets for buying.
I have taken so many days off school because of this game. Its a trap!
Đa best
Rage.
The best game i have ever played.One of the most engaging communities i have ever been a part of. Unlimited Gameplay for just 20$the best.just outstanding. Graphics super good.Optimization GoodFPS easily getting 100 120+ frames. (check my profile bio for my specs)Enjoyment TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE!
fix the tickrate is all i ask
needs optimization
This is a very well made game. Though it has in its earliest stage lots of glitches and bugs. This is forgivable only because it came out a few days ago. I feel like the killer the Wraith is overpowered because it can move so fast and the only things that give it away is the very hard to see patches of body and weird grunting it makes. I don't like the fact the add ons only last for one round i think they should last at least 2 or maybe more rounds. Other than that the game is pretty good. The character progression is great and the gameplay is mostly smooth. I would recommend this game to more advanced player who can easily make it over the learning curve that comes with this game.
the game is very beautiful but the publisher broken lot of the game balance
Fun!
This game in its infancy is truly beautiful. It runs faultlessly on my system (ran better once transferred to SSD) which was a surprise.This is early access but the content already in it is enjoyably good. Look forward to a more explanative interface on what things do but the trial and error to find out is fun.Just waiting to try multiplayer now.I7 3770k32GB RAMGTX 1070 8GBWindows 10
It's good but gets boring after quite a few rounds also devs lieing is not okay. /
fun
always crash wtf mantoo many bughackerbut the price still samepubg make your pc crash and problemZzz
100 hours in and it's only getting better!
Online is lots of fun with friends. Vehicles that were introduced in the base game are best because they are reasonably prices. All dlc items cost outragious amounts of money in game. Heists are poorly executed. General combat and exploration is enjoyable though.
rockcunt
RIP OpenIV &lt /3
Addicting to play. Only soccer I care about.
be playing for hrs get lost in the game find some friends a group of 6 build a base guy comes with guns and only 4 of us left base get broken in to lose even more stuff base is now some ones else 100/10 would do it again
hello can anyone buy me gta 5 please biiiiich
I am enjoying this game so much! Astrimetrical games like this are the future of gaming. They should make a Preditor game like this.
f*ck hacker f*ck blue hole
This game is so freaking frustrating but i love it
EN worst game i ever bought in my life. dont buy this game ffs.play fortnite. i thought that pubg would beat the BR experience but fortnite is way better trust me!PT BR se arrependimento matasse... pior 50$ que eu gastei na minha vida poderia ter comprado varios caldicana.não comprem por nada! o fortnite q parece jogo de criança fornece um battle royale mil vezes melhor q essa porcaria tudo quebrada. desenvolvedores tratam esse jogo como lixo. devem estar com a nossa grana no BAHAMAS agora.
The game is nice i played it for about 3 days but when the admins on the servers started to destroy everything i build i just quit playing. Community Servers i have to add
In these almost 50 hours I've spent in this game I have yet to face any server/queue/matchmaking issues and perhaps like 95% of the time was spent actually playing the game so that's definitely a positive start. Regarding actual gameplay there are a lot of bugs I can't deny that however they're minor and have no impact on the ability to play the game and enjoy the core idea of this game. The real gameplay excluding the bugs is what makes this game stand out in BR scene it has a lot of depth (plenty of things you can do with different tactics smokes hearing other people staying in the shadows etc.) in my opinion close to a perfect combat system (can't even compare it with h1z1) and these are the things that I consider high end priorities for such game.
Fun for a day or 2. Then it is boring.
i love it i found a military grade assault rifle in a box that fell from the sky it felt like i was in russia
"Pros Good graphics Realistic Incredibly fun to play with friendsCons Bugs and glitches Bad optimization Hackers Terrible serversIt is supposedly ""fully released"" but it still has all the problems of an early access game. It seems that they only fully released it to make it more attractive for buyers"
This aint soccer.
scarier than any horror game 10/10
If you are into some really strategical business planning or just blowing some time with your friends doing races collecting cool cars having a business of your own. All that in a massive multiplayer world. This game is for you. Awesome!
Great game for practicing home invasions.
Really good game. Alebit it very lacking in content. Inconsistent framerates also plague what is otherwise a really fun game. Expect to have a blast until the lack of content becomes prevalent.
f you T2
Rust currently is the best game for survival with stuff like raiding bases tons of pvp plenty of weapons to choose from tons of clothing and armour a handful of attachments for said guns and a base design feature that can allow you to build almost any base to your desire the other thing Rust is amazing at is gun play the guns feel amazing to shoot and the recoil is learnable but can still take time the weapons also do balance damage and can be reletively easy to get but most likely you will spend the most time with a bow/crossbow or a revolver or if you get lucky a semi automatic rifle or SAR for short. Now for the end game you have Ak's Bolt actions LR 300's L96 snipers C4 Rockets satchels and lastly explosive ammo for you weapons. Of course all is well and good until you get raided which with a bad base design can be easy or with a good base design hard but good base designs can be learned with time and you can always rebuild if you do get raided but most of the time you will get raided when you are offline not online. Vexxed
Love the game so far but I'm hoping for a party system instead of just trying to join the same lobby over and over /
The Best Game....Lit
ok
"I struggle to recommend this game anymore for the last 2 years the updates to the online mode have progressed to charging far more than its worth in in game currency . to buy everything in one update you'd either have to play hundreds of hours of the same heist doing the same setups and the same final without variation. Or just spend 250 and have enough in game money to buy it all. Even when you opt to play the heists the community (if you could bring yourself to call it that) only wants to play the final . For you to play your own heist there is an hour ""cool down"" in which you cannot start a new heist but if you only search to join a heist final this does not apply to you. the payouts are tiny compared to the cost of a dlc car to buy 1 dlc super car you can expect to have to play the hardest heist 3 4 times depending on your cut.I would recommend the single player but compared to a newer game it is not worth the asking price alone. so if you care enough about gta's drive here shoot this gameplay I'd wait for a half price sale because the story or fun vehicles/ weapons are not up to the standard of gta San Andreas a game that was a DECADE old on the initial release of this game."
Soccer with rocket cars.It's a great game to play with friends and just derp around in. It's simple easy to get cosmetics and can get pretty intense.
Take Two really disappointed in your decisions. Not cool.
No more mods? why else do you think all of us chumps bought a copy for PC?
Alpha as
Thumbs down?Half of negative reviews seems to be done by kids who were trying to run game on their old laptops or potatoes other half complaining about bugs.. Its early access you morons. Either way its 100 times better optimalized and got 100 times less bugs than ark. And its only just came out. I recommend game even in this stage and even without discount. Only question im asking myself while playing this game is how the #$% no one invented smthing like this till now.
Lovely game &lt 3
I ran my friend over with a plane.10/10 would do it irl.
this game is realy fun and should be played with frends
This game is beautiful. It's in Alpha and has so much potential. From the time that I have put into this game I have died several times though I still keep finding myself playing and fighting through the tough times. Love this game and the developers are genuises! Good Job FacePunch on yet another great game!
bruhhhhh sik carrss and sportball?!!?!? 10/10 would paally again!
awesome
Amazing just amazing. Hours and hours of fun quick 5 min games mean you can jump in an jump out but inevitabely as usual you spend all night. Can't beat the feeling of scoring and that Superman like theme playing at that moment. A real challange to master getting position / angle on the ball real skill needed. And combining driving with football what's not to love?
you get over it in about 1 month
Improve weapon design please. Bring back the excitement of unlocking a new upgrade tree and seeing the awesome look of new weapons. I love this game. I'm just giving this review so that there's at least a chance that the devs will notice this.
Product received for free. Highly recommended!
if i were you id just wait for the game to improve before you buy it /
Stop screwing up your games man let the community do what it does best make things interesting so that they want to continue playing the stuff you create!
It has everything you'd think this game should have. The custom matches don't work yet but this game is still in beta. When it becomes available. I'd like a setting to allow the map's alphabetical boxes that grid the map as you look at it to become randomly filled with the blue circle thing instead of the blue circle thing restricting you to a defined region that you have to run your *** off to get to. It would make it more like Battle Royale the movie. Since that's what they do in the movie. They marked the maps to regions that were 'locked' and anyone inside of it would die off if they remained in it. This would give the online battles more longevity for those who like to have things feel a bit more campy. Plus it would make it easier for beginner players to survive longer.Also maybe opening up the workshop would be nice to have some custom weapons and armor and clothing etc. Although the grid blue box thing would be the only thing I'd want more out of anything else.I am not sure what else I thought might be nice for this game. Although that's all. I will return and fix this review when I've thought of more stuff. Otherwise It's a great game and I can see why people play it so often. Worth checking out for an hour. Incase your unsure.P.S It would be nice to have a feature where we can see who we've played with in the past few games. Like Xbox does. So we can friend ppl when we've forgotten to afterwards.
here is a summary of your average game when you dont fall through the map&gt spawn in&gt drop somewhere&gt get good stuff&gt get car&gt get kar'drinse and repeat for about 3 hours and that is the pubg experiencenever mind spawning in and falling through the map when we got skins
"After spending almost all of my time in Single Player messing around with mods (which after story is the only interesting thing to do) Take Two after selling 80 million+ copies says they're ""undermonetizing"" and then destroys all mods. Was a fun game and the story was enjoyable online can be cancer"

Its a great game but half the time its not even ing responding
"So the game is okay I think Civ 5 AND 4 were better so I would recommend those over this. That the previous games did things ""better"" is of course personal opinion yet there is another reason I would not recommend this.There is a disturbing attempt to change a personally owned game into the new ""Games as a service"" by forcing an updated user agreement that did not exist at the launch of the game and if you like having your files personal or dont want to agree to give them the information they want then you cant play the game anymore. Thats a very shady move. To think that all they need to do to take away ownership or how you play a game no matter how old the game is is just to update a new user agreement.That would be like Nintendo in the 80's locking a NES copy of Super Mario with radio waves and not letting you play it unless you mailed them a signed letter. The letter saying that you agreed to hand over your address book and photo album if they decided they wanted it in return for letting you play your... ummm actually now its THEIR game. Thats insane id rather vote with my wallet and play a less intrusive game."
Must admit that although the game has countless issues the random nature of the game partnered with the skill required make PUBG a very enjoyable experience. Almost 300 hours deep now and ive had plenty of laughs from the game light hearted play and tryhard rounds are both viable options
Fun and addicting to play.
Got hunted by the KKK within 5 minutes.10/10
not bad
I knew nothing about this game. Downloaded it for free on Ps4. Now I can't stop playing it bought it on steam cause my Ps4 went in for repairs. Thanks for my wife off Psyonix!
we need mod..take two.. u take to much
whenever the 556 come back I will come bcak this stupid game
It's a pretty cool game for a beta release! Love it!
only one. Please enable the mod for online
Not for the feint of heart but a good time.
Pretty fun game to play with your friends playing on your own isnt nearly as fun unless you are trying to get really good.
This game is not worth the full Price. Get it only if its like 5 Bucks. Massive bug and balance issues most toxic community i ever seen (worse than lol) no dedicated servers and devs.Game is poorly optimized so it runs poorly. A lot of hacking and Exploring. Random sometimes undeserved bans and no bans for obvious cheaters. Dont recomend.
wanna play some dawn raid?
rockstar and taketwo is greedy. rip modding community
After 200+ hoursbugs russians offline raids
This game is highly addictive. But I've rage quit at least 40 times in the past week from consistantly getting raided and killed. It's a very good game but if I continue playing I'm going to punch a hole through my computer screen. Would NOT recommend to the average player. I've played 93.6 hours in the past 2 weeks. That's a full time job and I wasted all that time. Big mistake getting this game.
Buy it.**EDIT** Still Buy it.
I was 9 years old i love Micheal like a gay man loves a pole. i prayed to micheal every night that he would show up and back hand pimp my grandmother. my brother overheard me and i had to silence him the only way micheal knew how. His ligaments hanged from my ceiling fan and i agressivly rubed rusty spoons as i played this wonderful game. I turned on the ceiling fan and my brothers torn of leg flew out my window and hit my mexican neighbors 16 yearold daughter. She had then developed stage 3 diabetes i havent heard from Kevin Hart Since then i dont think hes even a 16 yearold mexican girl anymore. all i know is lesters a straight up G. But wait Anthony Sully Sulivan here to tell you theres more!!! you see this game isnt any old fps theres a map open world and guns and clubs.If your whistle isnt wet yet then you must be climping the wrong Mountain. Morgan Freeman even supports this game now why would an old black man would tollerate a crap game. his voice is god do you think gods voice would like a crap game. Now please note this may not be the true opinion of Morgan Freeman maybe he doesnt know what gta5 is all i know is that i like waffles.
game is a riot
Very recommmended.
cool
Ah rust where everyone hates you and your rock is the only starting weapon. Good game just remember that everyone wants to kill you.
Love it needs to be optimized more tho
great multiplayer with good graphics and pretty timepass game just go for it.
So i have played a little over 300 hours on this game not a heap but enough to have a decent opinion on the game. The problem with this game is the more you play the worse it gets. Not much point selecting a specific server when they're all full of chinese anyway. This game started off as a pretty well received game and even though it had lots of glitches in early access lots of them were fixed. However this game was rushed to a version 1.0 release and rushed to be released on console. The game is now full of hackers and laggy servers. The developers no longer care about actual gameplay and instead release 6 gig updates entirely based on cosmetics and tiny bug fixes. This game is currently a horribly optimized mess and i would avoid buying it.If your looking for a battle royale game i would suggest playing either Islands of nyne or Escape from Tarkov they are well balanced have dedicated spray patterns and can easily maintain a stable framerate they also constantly receive new content from the developer and bug fixes as well as not being plagued by hackers.Edit 1 Wow what do you know i'm still playing this heap of game i've played another 250 hours since i wrote this review and if i'm being completely honest the game has not improved. The physics engine in this game is so broken you can literally drive over a bump at 10 km/h and end up doing 4 backflips and blowing up. And the game run so badly still how has this not been fixed?I mean how do you even manage to lower the optimisation of the game with every update? Also who thought the event pass was a good idea??? Nice job B team.
watch out for those 12is but great game
Simple answer is this game is not fun. Long answer is that I can see why people like this game. It really draws you in and gives you the urge to keep playing. You spend 30 minutes running around trying to find better items. The last 10 minutes of a match you spend trying to dodge the oddest firearm controls I have ever seen in a game. As an example I just finished a round where the player who killed me first nearly blind fired a sniper rifle at me and hit then pulls out his M4 with a holographic sight and proceeds to just lob bullets at me killing me. The match before that I was toe to toe with an enemy. On my screen I unloaded an entire magazine into him he ended up killing me. Upon watching the replay it showed I didn't make a single dent in his heath. Ultimately this is my biggest issue with this game. The gun mechanics do not make any sense and are not natural. The graphics are nice but I have had instances where because my graphic settings are different from other players they may not see the vegetation I am hiding in so to them I am just crouched in the middle of a field. The network backend always has some form of lag in it and constantly throws error messages saying it couldn't connect. Other than that the game is solid. Looking at other players feedback it seems I am not the only person to feel this way. If it is on sale I say go for it but I wouldn't pay full price for it again.
"FAILED TO JOIN THE GAME? DEVELOPERS WILL SAY TO YOU ""F*CK OFF"" AND ALL THEY WILL DO PATCHES THAT WILL DO NOTHING SEAT SIMULATOR 2016. 10/0(PLAY WITH FRIENDS HAS NO STILL)"
One of the best games that you can play on PC even in 2019.
Product received for free. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm AWESOME.
This game is a good duo and squad game. but when it comes to solo. its just campers
Great game. Really fun and competitive. Haven't experienced any bugs.
A+++
Really bad game there is SO MUCH wrong with it. it like it's just copied from Console to PC and not optimalised in any way
Good game
If u want to do quests and never run out of em then 10/10 u need to play skyrim
this game already good but need fix bug and please ban all cheater like fast run and noclip bullets

I loved how I always get killed by hackers.
Just a rly great game
The game is fun until you run into other people.
Easy to pick up. Difficult to master. Highly addictive. Highly polished. Works well with Nvidia 3d vision.
Really great game the guns are balanced being steathy is rewarding most of the time but can we get the ability to wheelie on a mortorcycle by like holding ctrl or somthing plz?
I like this game The campfires work so well that my GPU even overheats )
yes
Remember when modders got job offers instead of cease and desist letters? Rockstar kindly go f yourself
this game is great but not for people under age.
I finished GTA V twice on my PS3. And now when I finally have a gaming rig this game is one of the 5 first game that I bought on steam. There's a reason why this 2015 game is still one of the most bought game on steam at 2016.
bad game
you take two you ruined a good game
I absolutely love this game! Not as scary as the trailers made one assume but it's still a wonderful game to play with friends!
Epic
So fun !
Really Fun can put lots of hours becuase of how good the game is. I mean soccer and cars what is there not to love. Real potential for Esports as well with very high skill ceiling for a lot of improvement
negro bandido la redada mi casa
I keep forgetting which side of the road to drive on when going between Europe and England.10/10
I gave this game a thumbs down because once you press auto sign in you can't disable it and if you get a perm ban you can't switch accounts which sucks.
I like it
A very good game...fun to play with friends...can be frustrating sometimes... Needs optimization.
Got given this as a gift from a friend. Sooooo cool obviously there are bugs as it is early release but I feel quite pleased to be part of the birth of such a fantastic game!
idk how to do this lol. im new xD
The game would be quite fun on it's own...but seems to suffer from a bunch of SOB's just ganking you from the get go when you only have a rock. This just spoils everything for me that this game could have been...After avoiding the gank fest problems on another server...this game still failed to live up to expectations. (
"Terrible. It was fun the first hour or so but then it became boring as hell. You just chase after a ball with zero teamwork. Honestly your own team ruins more than it helps.The MMR (if there is any) is horrible as well since I've played multiple games where I'm in a full team of ""rookies"" vs a full team of ""semi pro's""."
Boring game no guide of what to do can t make a single player to get to know the game in multiplayer everyone kill you even if you dont have anything no one answer the questions of a new player long loading time 2/10.
So much fun holy ++++ Cons pc controls are bad but if you have ebox remote or ps4 just use that 10xbetter loads of play time lots of fun to play
This game is kinda aids
love it
Terribly unoptimized and buggy yet the developer's prioritize making more content for microtransactions (along with rushing it to Xbox).I bought this on impulse and never really got into it. Don't fall for the hype. It's just a fancy FFA game mode. Go play Fortnite which is this but better because of a smaller map and additional layer of gameplay (building)
very good game like it
yea nice game
Great!
Hey that's pretty good
"This game makes me ""reee"" very loud so that I wake up my neighbors. Pros Good graphics.Good gameplay.Good amount of toxicity.Cons I got evicted from my house from screaming too loud and cops came twice aswell as the swat team. (my neighbors thought i was murdering people irl)"
Product received for free. esse jogo e muito bom para vc passar o tempo mas ele é muito limitado pois quem não tiver um computador intermediario não vai conseguir rodar.Mas deixando isso de lado o jogo tem uma balistica e Fisica realista como por exemplo (BulletDrop BulletTravel e ETC) o que torna o jogo mais realista e dificil. porem recentemente depois da atualização 1.0 chegou muitos Cheaters (Trpaceiros hacks) que deixou o jogo não jogavel raramente eu caiu em um lobby sem Hack. enfim como eu vi que tera um patch que arrumara os problemas de cheat eu vi outros problemas como por exemplo os Asiaticos em geral fazendo time o que torna o jogo literamente não jogavel.fora isso o jogo vem evoluindo desde junho do ano passado (a epoca que eu comprei o jogo) antes o jogo era mal otimizado e agora a empresa esta lutando para que isso não aconteça e isso é legal porem como eu sei que isso vai ser uma epoca do jogo entao minha analise e positiva
This game had a lot of potential to bad its full of hackers
I L0VE THE GAME I GIVE IT A 8/10 I LOVE THE GAME OUT OF ALL MY FAVREIT GAMES THIS IS MY FAV EVERY ONE I I HOPE YPOU FIND THIS USFULL IN THE FUTERE SHOW IF THEY WANT THIS GAME
Product received for free. As if i I didn't already sink the better part of my adulthood into Skyrim Legendary Edition Steam now offers to play the same game with the same story and content but BETTER GRAPHICS and sold as 'Special Edition' again. Plot Twist Hours played in the original Skyrim don't mean sh*t in this new item dwelling in my library nagging me to play.11/10 will waste equally as much time on this game AGAIN
FIX. YOUR. GAME.
What do you think of when you see cars in a game? Probably of a Racing Game.But Psyonix developed a really nice game where you use cars to play soccer.I actually don't like soccer that much but that game EPIC!9/10 points. Only the physics are sometimes a bit strange.
iconic
Full disclosure I 've spent WAY more time playing this on my PS4 than on my PC. + Ridiculously fun. Addictive. Extremely accessible. Very difficult to master. As with any multiplayer game the hordes of s you 'll encounter while playing online.
Great game totally worth buying )
wtf !! cannot select sever .. make PING UP !!! +++ Fuc k **
6/10 you like cars? you like football (we don't say soccer)? well I have good news for you
absolute trash
"Peer to peer connection in 2018 (so those greedy madafakers dont have to pay for servers). Grindfest of bloodpoints (to unlock meta perks that are also locked behind paywall and are a must if you want to actually get anywhere near to a reasonable rank). Bugs and crashes everywhere. Full of salty teen monkeys. Developers absolutely incompetent when it comes to balancing their steaming pile of shet that they call a game.""Do you recommend this game?"" Holy no no I dont."
THIS IS ING FUN MAN. YOU NEED TO BUY THIS. YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN FROM OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT ALL THE BUGS KINKS AND ANNOYANCES THUS FAR (REFER TO OTHER REVIEWS). THE BIGGEST THING FOR ME IS THE PLAYING WITH FRIENDS OR LACK OF IT.. FOR NOW (HOPEFULLY??) ALSO SORT OF ANNOYING THAT THERE ISN'T ANY SORT OF CHAT SYSTEM OR EVEN A VOICE SYSTEM AT ALL. THERE'S BOTH PROS AND CONS TO THIS. POINTS SYSTEM IS HORRID FOR BOTH SIDES AND CAN EASILY BE ABUSED (SEE OTHER REVIEWS FOR ME DETAILS). BUT OVERALL THIS IS ING FUN LOL. AND IT HAS GIVEN ME A FEW JUMP SCARES SINCE I PURCHASED IT AND DEFINITELY GETS MY HEARTBEAT UP A BIT WHEN THE KILLER IS NEAR AND THE HEARTBEAT SOUND STARTS PLAYING.YOU SHOULD STILL BUY THIS GAME AT 15 DOLLARS WHICH IS A PRETTY GOOD DEAL I THINK. I'M SURE IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE POPULAR IF IT WENT ON SALE FOR 10 THOUGH. SIDENOTE IT DOESN'T LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN A 5 DOLLAR GAME TBH AND AT TIMES SEEMS TO PLAY LIKE ONE AS WELL BUT I'M HOPING THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED IN COMING UPDATES. BUT IT CERTAINTLY PLAYS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED IT AND I AM GLAD I GOT IT FOR $15.99.
Cool to play with friends!
Salt enducing BUT a lot of fun to play with friends.
UN ING PLAYABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Fatal error on start... everytime I launch the game Don't waste the ing money
Online is so cancer yet so fun DDD
Best game if you want to play with hackers ) 10/10 Hackers 4/10 game play! Game is pretty fun unless you're hacking ) So if you're not the best you could do is feed yourself to the hackers D
Don't buy it it's full of cheaters. Get something better and worth your money.
Dis Game take pretty long but isok
Publishers sued 3rd party mod makers will never be as fun as San Andreas Multi Player (SAMP) mod was. I dont care for instanced out mini games and chopped up worlds pretending to be open world. Played less then 5 hours uninstalled will not touch the game again. I personally hope this genre dies off or the devs do etc.
Fun while it lasted bit boring now
Awsum gam! Luv iz! &lt 3
Best Happy Game to spend your time on you always gets something either you lose or win )Give it a try and get addicted 3#BigThumbsUpEDIT The game is getting more smexy day by day
Take Two should just shut the hell down at this point. OpenIV did not deserve thatEDIT So they did back down. Good. Still not changing my review and I urge others to do the same. We're not getting fooled again
I bought the game for 60 bucks and after 3 days I got banned First time for 30 day for no reason. I want refund the game but after more than 2 hour this is impossible. For the false ban no one buy this game only after when they fix this because this is a joke. I know there are a lot of modders and cheaters who say the same thing but for 60 bucks some kid report you for nothing and the ban hammer smash you this is not a game for me. I forgot this game for a life. I know I didnt got perma ban only 30 day but really I fear the next login I get another 30 day or a perma ban this is the reason I never want to paly again. With this automatic false ban system I cant recommend this game for anyone. I read a lot of forums running programs can trigger the automatic ban system like antivirus or anything. The customer support is...no...I think I no need to say anything about the customer support. Only give you back the policy with you breaked the rules. But what rules you never know and dont explain it. How this game is so popular like this? A tons of people got the same things. Somebody preordered the game and the first login is a 30 day ban? And he/she not the first case. This game is a joke. (Online part). Fix the automatic ban system. I cant recommend this game sry.(Sry for english but I think you can understand.)
No Cloud support.My hdd was broken replaced SSD instead of.My Whole Save Files has gone god damn Rockstar.
TRASH
so many games that are free are much better than this one..
这游戏感觉容易腻 配置需求也比较高 游戏环境也不是很好 当然我自己买了后玩了2个多小时就不想玩了 偏偏玩了2个小时就不能退款了 气的一批
dont buy this .. it has a lot of bug .. now i cant playing for the black textures bug i cant see every object in game. dev guys never fix even know this problem. totally failed the game
Very good game if you like battle royale genre titles. It's still in the works however they are going to be bringing some amazing new features to the game soon
Veryc nice
*Logs on rocket league for the first time**plays first match*OMG TAHT WAS SO FUN TIME FOR ANOTHER ROUND!*What i think is half an hour later*WTF?!? IT'S 5 00 am IN THE MORNING! WAHT!Got friends? Got family? Not anymore you dont.
This game is repeatedly updated to provide some more fun (but stupid) content. Wait for it to be on sale before buying it.
Pretty shizah
need more optimization!!!!
Cool and exciting game. Looking forward to playing it more!
I found an open window to a fortress took it over the old owners took it back after awhile i raided the same building 4 times until they finally got there house fully protected and after almost getting killed the last time I wanted to try to take a swim turns out i dont know how to swim and so i lost every bit of guns ammo and food i had stole... then i camped out waiting for someone to open a door killed the man and raided the same house again and got killed by a bear later 10/10
Frustrating adictive and fun in equal amounts.
This game is a little (a lot) overhyped. ProsGood GunplayCan play with friendsFreaking hardConsYou can't just sit down and play it there are really long matchesmatchmaking sucksVery buggyIt is hard to have funthroughout the 50 or so hours playing this game i have only had 2 memorable moments that were fun and both of them were glitchesTextures will not load for like 2 minutes so I cant get any weaponsGame is unstableThe price is way to highThis game I would recomend geting on sale but for the full price it was not worth it4/10$30 wastedALSO just got banned because hacked my account and played this game for some reason
kek
Great concept and gameplay mechanics mostly. Awful performance optimization. Not really worth $30 at this point specially if you run AMD graphics cards.
"While this game is full of amazing contents two things that stick out makes playing MHW not that pleasant 1. Playing with mouse and keyboard is a pain in the (I don't know that situation with controllers). Many actions (like aiming with ""V"" instead of right click) are very counter intuitive and take a long time to get used to.2. Online feature is absolute crap. Constant disconnect or unable to connect"" even after the latest updates. Once I am disconnected I can't reconnect without waiting for a few hours. Capcom has worse servers than Ubisoft."
I originally played this game when it first came out and when I learned that it was on Steam I was hesitant to buy it. I ended up getting it and I never regretted buying it.
Nice Game D
styled cars + football fun + skill
yes
Every feature of this game is just amazing. D D D D
Hard and stressfull at the start however after some time playing this gets only better. The fact that I never rage also helps.Some things are buggy this and the optimization needed are the only problems for me.
The game is actually good but sometimes it was buggy on update 1.0. But it's ok i enjoyed playing this game and i hope on the next update the game will no longer been have a bug. That's why i thumbs up on this game )
I just play this game to go to the strip club and get a $1 000 worth of lap dances because I am rich in the game but sadly broke in real life and can't afford to spend that kind of money on hookers. /
nice game
Terrible sounds engineCancer movement mechanics NO hit indicator for FPP LAG
yeah its good but not great u know? but it worth
Very fun and well made... unlike this short review )
Optimize it then I will review it.
The game itself is good and enjoyable to play. The issue is that despite the game being popular and out for some time there is a truly ungodly amount of lag. I have a stable connection with decent speeds and this game is forever lagging. People lag through doors being closed fist fights and can be stood still through an entire clip of an Uzi before they band to the other side of the building and kill you.Then there are the bugs. Holy God the bugs. People are clipping through everything guns randomly don't work and you can be firing madly through your scope and be hitting nothing but dirt because the game thinks you're prone when you are stood up.Not recommended on the sole basis that the developers seem to think that because it's popular they can sit and release a new map and forget that this is still early access and full of issues.
Fun game and it takes time to get good. Matchmaking system is garbage. You get teamed with/against random ranks that don't have to be anywhere close to your skill level. Also if you leave a game it might put you right back into it thats stupid.
Well another game bites the dust due to Chinese hackers and lack of region lock. Shame too was a real nice one. 0/10
Many bug and soo many cheaters and guys camping all game and always sh*t loot
Slavery
best games for the genre of action adventure and open world game
Cool
Why are you like this stop ing the game up
Bet product ever
"Have been playing this game since 2014 Back on PS3. Bought the game again 2 years later on PC.The game is amazing and rockstar comes with overpriced junk that we buy anyway.The studio that said a weaponized vehicle would be 2OP littarly made a flying delorean that can shoot the most accurate rockets in this planet. (I don't own one as i never PVP I would rather help everyone)I'm not saying it's a bad thing rockstar made an amazing game and brings out amazing updates for itI just wish people would be less .This game grows everyday more with new players Show them how amazing this game is not how every bad thing.Every game has it's ""bad"" side.Forgive and forgetThis game lived on since 2013And it won't die anytime soon"

I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!I did not buy it on release because my excitement was building up too much and I felt if I bought it at the time I might have died as my heart would have exploded because of the sheer excitement. Now I'm thinking what the actual fuc* is this I'm not a retard in understanding it's soccer (get triggered deal with it) but with cars. I'm literally getting rammed up the back end getting hit on the side (weren't supposed to sound sexual) and blown up into pieces. Everytime I am hit it's like my black self goes back into the slavery period and getting whipped uncontrollably. The cars are crap I've got a fast car and my opponent has a big truck you would be thinking that I should win the race to the ball everytime. NOPE not in this fuc*ing game the big truck always wins this game is a mess surely the developers went to school to learn about physics regarding weights? Oh don't forget the new 'added' features that are free you now get fuc*ing crates that are rewarded which you then have to spend 1.19 on a key to unlock a crap decal or a new hat. I'm playing a car football game not pimp my ride. I would like to add shooting pace and skill attributes to my professional car not change the wheels to look cool and pull some birds in my whip and taking them to Mcdonalds for a 99p hamburger. Then the team mates you get put with on the game they are window lickers and play as if they're playing the game with their feet. Always get team mates that score a remarkable own goal that only themselves could score because of how fuc*ing sh* they are at the game.. Whenever I try to score a goal the ball bounces about 12 million times hitting the post crossbar cars floor ceiling before the magnet out of no where attracts the ball into my own goal and the opponent winning because of BS.I would rather watch the Super Bowl LI again where it took over 4 hours for the game to finish when it should have finished in 1 hour it's ridiculous how it's classed as a sport Golf goes a faster pace than American Football. Anyway back to the review the game is trash just literally caked in shi* and I feel ripped off everytime I play it. Get some toy cars and a bouncy ball and you've replicated Rocket League. I'm pretty sure I discovered this game when I was about 5 years old I was just too young to copyright the game well I've got photo evidence of me playing the same concept so be prepared to get sued Psyonix.
Good
You'll be lucky to find a game that matches this in terms of having a ton of fun with your mates. Server issues and loading times aside the game is a masterpiece in terms of out and out FUN.There isn't much to say grab some mates jump into an online game and decide from a million different possibilities from there. If I could afford to upgrade my PC I'd have way more hours in this. Unfortunately the newer updates pretty much broke the game on my poor 50 CPU.
Нармальна
its ight
Pretty good game but yo have to be good with guns n like bows crossbows etc the game is fine but a little to much toxicity and hackers
The content releases have been GREAT! The downside is that Rockstar / Take Two are massively cashing in on in game micro transactions. This has made all the new fun content nearly inaccessible. It's a shame that they seemingly designed the game around those shark cards. With the addition of the recent backlash from the modding community it has brought this game down from an all time favorite to something rather dissapointing. The game could have still been great... but it left me with a bitter taste and I wouldn't recommend it anymore.
Playing squad is super fun!
good game
Coke dealing simulator.
Take Two is essentially ruining the fun of single player. Cease and desist sent to OpenIV. Do not support Take Two or Rockstar until they fix this.
If you're into realistic military shooters you'll want to add this game to the list.If you're coming from H1Z1 or are new to this type of game I still recommend trying it but made a pros/cons list in case you're on the fence about it.PROSThe Weapons They feel and sound great to use. Large variety that are all impactful in different scenarios.Game Tempo A great mix between downtime/intense ramp up and blood boiling firefights. Sound Great sound design! Learn to pay attention to receiving and making sound from footsteps gunfire vehicles etc.Tactics/Strategy Decision Making at every turn. Hint Its different every time!Co op Unrivaled team play! Team up with a friend or 3 for some good times.CONSEarly Access Expect lower FPS server lag random bugs.Pistols Near useless except for the first minute of the game.Cheaters Not game breaking since the games are relatively short (5 20 mins). But they're there.Luck of the Draw This isn't CS GO. You can go into it with a pro mindset only making the most logical decisions and still die to random scenarios like a vehicle clipping through a rock to kill you.There's much more to this game than initially meets the eye. It almost feels like a roguelike in that you learn something new almost every playthrough. 400+ hours in and having reached top 50 in solos and duos but I still have a lot to learn.TLDR You can wait for the full release to try and avoid dealing with early access issues but you'll surely encounter them anyway after a major patch. Its the nature of an online game. Just pick it up and enjoy it with your friends while the hype is there you wont regret it!If you've read this entire review good on you! Heres a little secret the game's 3D sound is wonky. Even if you have it through a sound card or a nice headset w/ software just turn it to stereo. It'll work wonders for you. Cheers!
l垃圾游戏
Honestly I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time. I had forgotten what fun is this though this is fun. Get it.
Overall the multiplayer work fine many activity to do solo or with other players. lots of updates make it more fun and excited to play. many ways to make more money. its a worth full game to play with
Freeze and crash atleast once an hour. By freezing i mean having to restart my whole pc. The game is fun but only when u are playing it...
Brilliantly balanced and exciting sci fi soccar (car soccer) game which is super addictive with no skill ceiling.
not as good as i expected but a lot more fun than i expected u better group up with mates while playing this game randoms will be hell of a butthurt. well made weapon model/stats/animation good gameplay the only down side is the game isnt really skill based luck really matters
Yes this game is bugged but so is every other early access game I have ever played. Anyone who puts negative comments up around that should really do a brain cell check as I think we are only up to week 22 of the game. Now all the whingers about paid content for the game all need a head check because the paid content is absolutely 100% not required to play any part of the game. It is just to change your chartacters appearance which I personally don't give two hoots about since all I want to do is get chicken dinners. Now gameplay is lots of fun. I mean who doesn't want to parachute into some old soviet island with a few of your mates try to one up each other with what loot you have found and then gho kill some players. Yes the game has some optimisation issues but the big difference is that the developer bluehole is very transparent around what the problems are and once they have been notified about any proiblems there is usually a facebook post letting you know they are working on a fix. Don't let the haters push you away from this game this is a true battle royale which isn't for the faint hearted and you should give it a solid crack. Although it might take you a little while to get your chicken dinner
just bought the game and the new rust will not open nothing loads rust legacy will work? why is this i spend 20 dollars on a broken game
Product received for free. great game 9.862513421 / 10
Rocket League! Where do I begin... Rocket League is one of the most inivative games to push the bounderies of sports. Picture yourself SOARING through the air with your only goal too get that good fast hit past the opponent. Rocket league takes soccer and gives it such a unique gameplay... VEHICLES! Be prepared to collide slide tumble and roll around in one of Rocket League's beautiful arenas! Ranging from sunny skies to skill deciding obsticles such as pillars hexagons and plateaus. Graphics 9/10I'd like to keep this short by saying Rocket League runs beautifully on most computers! You can have it optimized for an older 21st century laptop or desktop. Amazing rain effects and tons of customization to take your style to the next level! Gameplay 9/10You start off in rocket league really doing whatever you want from bot matches to hopping right into ranked (not recommended....) Rocket league teaches you patience and causes you to become an overall better gamer! Gameplay modes include 1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4 3v3 Rumble 3v3 Hoops Ranked ques of 1's 2's 3's 3v3 Rocket Labs You also have the full ability to host private lobbies with all sorts of mutator settings! From double speed to half... Quad collision effects to none at all! Change the shape and size of your ball to increase the chaotic aspect! Music 8/10Here's the thing... I don't think I've ever played a game and actually desired to find that perfect balance of volume for the games soundtrack... because well... It's AWESOME! Such a big plus when you load up a game to a beautiful symphony of electronic waves pulling you closer to that QUE button...TL DR Rocket League is an awesome new genre of competitive gameplay that you MUST try at least once.. But don't be alarmed when you fail and fail. This is one of those games in which you could spend 1.000 hours and still be working towards getting that GREAT wall shot.
a nice game with an original gameplay. Played on single player is quite boring and after 1 day you already want to trash it. His strength is online where competitive battles are really exciting. Sadly the online is also his weakness with too many frustrated people (kids most of the time) who can't accept defeat and start to insult everybody (usually their teammates) like they are the only ones good enough to play this game. More you go high in competitive matches more people like this you'll meet and then it will start to lose most of the fun.In short a good game ruined by bad players. I played for long in my life and rarely seen such a bad community full of angry kids. Not even in Call of Duty. I have more than 330 hours played on Rocket League (I have the Master title and Gold rank in all the competitives games) and I've already seen so many bad players that I could fill a continent. update Also they released a Game of the Year version which includes a few DLCs but there's nothing for who already owns the original game. We have to buy the DLCs separately which costs a little more. It would have been nice if there was a season pass.
yes.
Total dog Graphics and gameplay are amazing when the game works which is mazbe 5% of the time.It fails to lauch almost every time and crashes during gameplay most times i'v play it.I have a dual graphic MSI GT70 laptop running 4th gen i7 and a GT870 graphics card which is more than ample for this game but the game code is broken even after patches and every fix i can find!I WANT MY MONEY BACK STEAM!
I made this review for the steam summer sale stickers
This game is amazing! My only complaint is that in order to get every weapon and vehicle available you have to buy it in Online mode. My story mode characters have hundreds of millions of dollars and nothing huge to spend it on anymore and I would love to try out the other vehicles where I don't have to devout hundreds of hours to rank up and buy them.
How can a game mix cars and soccer and make it so much fun? I don't know but they have with this game. I love how the games are SHORT (5 minutes) but yet so so enjoyable. This is one of the best games I have played in a long time.
story mode is nice. Online mode is 80% loading 20% playing against people that have spent thousands of dollars on the game.
This game is full of hackers. Gaming experience is extremely bad. You just can't win a game with your own skill.
I hated car and football games.But combination of them is awesome.Best game ever!!!10/10
"Rocket League is incredible fun at all skill levels. Can barely hit the ball? Run aerial training three times a day getting perfect each time? Either way grab a group of buds who can do about as much as you can and you'll all have a blast. Short match times keep the game fresh and exciting. Car customization is nice and gives you something to do in game if you want a few minutes' break from the action.I only have one small nitpick The ""Flames"" decal on the old Hotshot model lined up the flames between the front and the sides if you looked from a certain angle but not with the new model. Guess you can't win them all."
This piece of game is so unoptimized. You will be lucky to join a lobby on your 10th attempt and then u will have to stare at a loading screen while sound is aready being played. If u decide to tab out to close this buggy mess u will be amused to find that ur resolution has been fcked to the point u cant even see where ur mouse is anymore. Most of the times when this happens u will have 4/5 of ur screen still blocked by the loading screen so u are unable to close it with ur task manager. After having to hard reset my PC for like the 7th time playing this game i had to encounter several issues including my TeamSpeak Client not working anymore and Steam still displaying me as if i was playing PUBG unable to restart it nor uninstall. Fk this piece of game dont be naive like me and hope for optimization from this incompetent developer and refund it. Save urself the 20 bucks until its full release or dont ever buy it because u will have a bad time if u so happen to get into a situation like me. It doesnt matter how powerful ur PC is because this game will still manage to crash itself and ur entire system in the process. On a sidenote tho if u manage to get into a round where u can actually see something dont be surprised if after exiting the plane u encounter missing textures and a world that looks like goo making u an easy target and putting u through the hell i described before once again.
Not worth time runs horibly fps lag as well as major desync issues. Don't waste your time
This game runs fine and currently no software crashes.PC environment Intel Core i7 7820X 4.5 GHz 32 GB DDR4 (3.2 GHz XMP) MSi X299 GAMING PRONVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Microsoft Windows 10 Pro x64 Version 1803Gaming performance 60 FPS 2560 x 1440 highest graphics settings
Good game to screw around in as well as be tactical and serious. Would buy again.
A really good game fun to play with friends although its hard for me to find good servers with low ping ...I am bored of hardcore gaming so this kind of 'casual' games can really entertain me ! Not the best buy but definately a good one !
raw game by now seemsgood tho (updated)
gol atmak zor geldi umarım sizin için öyle olmaz D
great game
gud
Product received for free. Best game I have ever played in my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just unenjoyable doesn't feel like a complete game.
"I bought this game on PC when it came out. At the time I didn't really care for mods. I then proceded to pour hours into this game 100% it twice. After that sure its okay and semi fun to run around and do stuff. The online I have also put a few hours in but it is so broken. And I don't just mean the hackers who can't really use OpenIV. The ""micro transaction"" are not micro anymore. Yea I put my $60 in to buy the game which is the most I have bought a game for but to do anything in the online you either have to grind for literal hours or buy a shark card. I would have less of a problem if it was balanced but its not.I could put in a ton of real money in the online and barely get enough to get an upgraded office. So the online isn't really something I do anymore. I just get on the online and there are hackers everywhere and OpenIV has nothing to do with them. And after playing so much of the single player it gets really dull. However mods ramp it back up and make me want to play it more. If it wasn't for mods I would only have about 60 or so hours in the game instead of around 400. Mods make it fun and T2 is now taking that fun away. I hope they change their minds and soon. I really think that there is going to be a significant drop in their revenue. THe score on Steam is dropping so fast. It used to be so Mostly Positive and now its Mostly Negative. GTA 5 is the fourth most popular game so far. ANd really if you think about it its more like the Second most popular and T2 is now trying to take even more money out of this game and its not good. It used to be so fun."
Great game it isn't perfect there are a lot of glitches but what a great game none the less and I wouldn't stop playing it because of that. I have many other games to play but always come back to pubg to play whenever I feel like gaming.
reaally fun and balanced played 6 hours the first time i played XD
Press F for respect OPENIV
Game is buggy you can't even hear footsteps clearly and then you have to increase volume and listen to the painful gunfire booming into ears sometimes I loose comection etc. I recommend you play this game when it's fully developed.
Very Fun Game Would Get if you have a good enough pcalso love that the old trailer and the new one are like the same XD
Very fun game. I would consider it a simpler version of Dayz but still fun as hell. You have a lot of fun creating your buildings and building up your defenses but then you also have to watch out for raiders. Everything you worked for can be taken away in a blink of an eye. But you can also fight back! Very exciting game. Can be considered a digital Cowboys vs. Indians.
Can be very fun but can also be very At times it is a tactical action packed shooter but sometimes i feel like it is a running simulator but it is still a very good game10/10
cheaters are god! ing cheating....!!!!
what a joke
Most fun ive had in a while
Don't buy this piece of bugging crap! The only good in this game is it's single player don't touch GTA Online you will vomit.
I really enjoy the premise of this game. However hackers have ruined it and made it unplayable...again. Just like they did with legacy. Unfortunatly I would not recommend this game because you will get frustrated after putting in the hard work and hours only to have hackers come along and take your stuff in 5 min. Jump hackers/speed hackers are the main problems I have encountered. I will not be playing rust agiain anytime soon its just a waste of time.
P E R F E C T I O N !
Runs poorly on good hardware. Major fps drops in any area with multiple other players making it a bit of a pay to win game since better performance makes combat more fluid. Rising problem with players with high ping creating lag zones around them.Gameplay is fun at times but nothing special. This game is buoyed by streamers and that's about it. I will not be purchasing anything else from this developer.
Still.. connection issues..It still makes up in content. The game has a lot.
This game can be as fun as you want it to be. This game can be relaxing to play with friends or you can make it try hard sweat dripping frustrating competitive to play. The game is super optomized and runs really smooth at unlimited FPS with great graphics.
game is trash. u run all game dont see anyone. map gets smaller ever couple min so u just run run run. then u either die from map shrinking or some random bs bc u have to shoot someone 10 times to kill them
suck game! dont waste your money on this sh*t broken! (i'm IGN reporter)
YA LIKE JAZZ???
Have almost 100 hours on record now and still haven't won yet. Great game )
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. THE DEVS ONLY CARE ABOUT MONEY AND ARE INCOHERENT TO EVERYONE ELSE'S OPINIONS !!! IN THE NA SERVER AT LEAST HALF THE PLAYERS ARE FROM AN INTERNET CAFE IN CHINA. NOT TO MENTION THEY ALL USE CHEATS LIKE AIMBOT/WALLS/INSTA HEAL/CHAMS/GOD MODE/FAST RUN/ ETC. ITS EXTREMELY ANNOYING TO PLAY EVEN WITH FRIENDS BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR AND FAVOURS PEOPLE WITH 200+ PING AND HACKS !!!! SO STUPID I REGRET EVER PLAYING THIS GAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Product received for free. Very good game! Loads of fun Solo or with Friends!!!

Hello my dear PUBG FRIENDS ) game is ok op shop lop top nob mob dob rob nvm im af game is okey ull get cancer by playing it but i rate it 9/11 would buy it again cancer cell
Its Good!
Personally not a fan. Everyone will kill you on site even if you have zero items on you. Resource gathering is also confusing at first and there's no character customization. Overall it'd be a decent game if it wasn't for the incredibly hostile players.
Very addictive and fun game. Solo can be exciting but the wipes and clans hammer you so it gets frustrating but none the less something to experience. With that playing with friends is also very fun also chosing who to trust is also interesting.The community can be somewhat toxic but then most of the time you realise you make the same decisions and actions that you complain about/ hate. Overall very fun but sometimes frustrating game.Really hope this game doesn't stay in Alpha forever but also really hope they add so much more to this game. Optimization could also use some work.
noice game many cars such rockets
Its GOOD
Product received for free. Realy good game but Story mode very short
ok game
Best battle royale game!
Guys this game is really good but it costs too much.
Yeah it's alright.
Good game
This game is ing garbage. I've met literally nothing but hostile s that can't ing respect the survival aspect of the game. They are always set for the whole wipe two ing hours into the game and do nothing but kill on sight. I get that pvp is a big part of the game but for s sake it gets rediculous when you never meet a single friendly person. The game is also the least noob friendly game I have ever played. And I've played the all the Dark Souls games. Also the controls are confusing and the level system is complete
best socer game ever plz play this game )
Addicting. Played this for a couple days now. It is definately a fun game. There are still quite a few bugs with Game rendering problems. But the gameplay is fun and easy. Feels like a combination of H1Z1 and Arma.
"Don't buy this game Take Two don't care about what their fanbase really want and are willing to do whatever will make them the most money.Also I shall touch on the whole OpenIV legal issue the fact is OpenIV doesn't actually mod GTA Online (which was what R* and Take Two said it did and said was why they were going after them legally) the way people actually cheat on GTA Online is with some DLL's injected with a DLL injector used to it would be done through an online bypassed ScriptHookV but that can not be done anymore. So the whole thing with OpenIV apparently doing something that is ""illegal"" is totally bogus.Just my two cents."
Product received for free. Good game ! )
addicting game. but sometimes laggy i recomend 110% mony worth
Very good game. Whether you are looking for a competitive game or something fun to mess around on with friends Rocket league is great. Different game modes like hoops dropshot and rumble add a new fun spin and im sure there are more modes in the works as the game updates regularly. Competitive is optimized well and they are always tweaking it. Competitive can be frustrating but that is the same with any game. Overall i would say this game is a solid 9.5/10. I would change it to 10/10 with more game modes but that is being very nitpicky.
This game make me cancer
Its an early access game so manage your expectations for this game. That aside I have played H1Z1 King of the Kill and this game is the exact same premise. Drop in find equipment survive. Where it differs is in the exectution. There is more of a variety of weapons and attachments. Hit boxes and spray patterns seem to be a little more under control. There are still weapons that you need to get otherwise your pretty much screwed just like H1Z1 KOTK. All in all though at least this game added a little variety to their maps like rain or sunset or mid day. This game is like a next level KOTK and I love it.

"Do you like killing teen agers? How about running away from pysco hillbillies with chainsaws? This might just be the game for you. Although if you like doing either of those things in the company of friends... well you better have atleast 4 other friends with 20 bucks in their pockets.TLDR Good game would recomend if you like to play soloThe week leading up to the launch of this title I was very excited. Watching a multitude of streamers play this game with their friends made me wish I could do the same. The hype was real. When the game went live a friend of mine and I bought this game anxious to cower in fear at the likes of machette clad macocists. We then spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to play together. Surely there was an ""invite a friend"" option we were over looking. After hosting and rehosting lobbies we discovered no such option exsists... What a let down! Dead By Daylight seems like the perfect platform to have a real horror shared experience with friends but the only way to accomplish this is in a private game. To me this seems like a huge over sight. Now understandably I can see the developers side of this decision. Sure playing this game as a survivor with a friend could lead to some already unbalanced game play however I think that the whole soul of this game revolves around surviving as a group and what better way to experience that than with a friend. In my opinion if the developers were worried about competetive balance they should have just made the match making system allow friends and then work on developing a more competetive game mode in the future.Rant aside let's talk about the game. Overall i really enjoy the game. The ambianceis perfect. The maps are creepy the character modles are pretty terrifying and the mechanics are pretty solid. The feeling you get as a survivor being chased through a cornfield by a psycotic chainsaw massacre ist is second to none. Likewise hunting survivors as a nearly invisible wraith is awesome. Sure there are some balance issues that are being addressed that is fine. I am happy that the developers are quick to patch this title.Dead By Daylight is certainly worth the money with one caveat I hope you like playing by yourself! I however do not and will probably not be playing this game too much until i can actually match make with my friends or somehow convince more of my friends to make the purchase."
Dis game is FANTABULAS!!!
I am a bit biased because I am already a fan of the Monster Hunter series but so far this game is amazing. Tons of little quality of life improvement from previous titles that make the game feel really slick and complete.Pretty graphics fun combat interesting new mechanics. Running a solid 60fps at max settings.The only cons I can think of are no ultrawide support poor mouse+kb support and some slightly lacking graphics options.
LOOT LOOT LOOT LOOT LOOT LOOT *headshot*Requeuerinse repeat D
This game is very fun but also very rage inducing it is super fun with friends especially with a lot of friends
"Well what can I say this game though what one hell of a difference compared to consoles so much more to do and a way much better than the they give you on consoles. I would say if you already have it on console or not get it on here as you will notice the hell of a difference on consoles it is 25 FPS or less and on gta V it is 60FPS so much better and smoother even in 4K so far better than consoles ""trash the consoles for the master race continues"" Luke"
Amazing game! Great with friends and is so much fun..
If u have friends and u didn t play in CS GO or Dota 2 u must buy it
A great party multiplayer game good gameplay mechanics. I like the idea it is something new and fresh. Really intense gameplay experience. The game is not polished like other aaa games but for the price under 20 euros it is a good choice to try this slasher movie'' game.
Best... BESTTTTT
too laggy for me i have like 10fps while playing this game. would recommend for stronger pcs
GAME OF THE YEAR!!! D H1Z1
This game is very fun and easy to run. Ran almost max settings 768p on my intel integrated graphics laptop
This game is actually my favorite game. It is easy to learn but extremely hard to master.10/10
This game Rocks its better than rock band.
Nice game
PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. More like PlayerUnknown's Chinagrounds
I usually get bored of games when I play them a lot but I just can't get enough of Rocket League! Everyday is a different story and it's always action packed!! 10/10
ing great game pretty dificult if you cant aim for only complaint is i can never get to airdrops but then again im at the game.
$59 lost. Game COULD be fun but this one missed out on its opening. Signicant network connection issues specifically connecting to with friends instances. Also disconnects while in instances with friends. Steam client also randomly disconnects causing MH to lose connection to instance. You stay in the instance but all other party members are gone. Also game default to a controller setting for a PC game. Shouldn't do this.
"I sure do hope Take Two don't ban the ""Not Recommeded Review"" mod."
12/10 would pan again
not recommended
Dead by Daylight is one of the best horror multiplayer games out there! Once you learn how to play you will have loads of fun chasing or being chased. It does contain features that could be improved but the best way to resolve all these issues with the game is getting more players and more community feedback. If you enjoy being under pressure feeling adrenaline and jump scares this is the game for you! Hope you enjoy your long nights playing it! Highly recomend it!
This game is absolutely terrible tons of bugs completely dependant on RNG and a ton of other t. And yet they decide to add weapon skins instead of fixing the damn game. DO NOT buy this game unless you want to cause yourself brain damage. 10/10 would refund it if I could.
Overall fun game even with all the bugs. It feels like the game is more survivor sided with there being more and more perks and balances to make the game easier for them. Really wish the devs added more things to make it fun. Like custom KYF where you could change the amount of survivors gens killers and have some community made maps. However in its current stance the game is a bit unbalanced and there are things that game could change.
Edited GTA V is good don't play the Online portion tho many hackers and cheaters. I cannot support this game anymore I bought Game Sharks but now I will not buy anymore.EDIT The game can be good if no cheaters are in the Session
I got around 70h playtime in story mode as i do not like the comments about online version and didn't play it.Story mode so single player was fun so far but slowly (actually since a while) it is getting boring.Actually all i was doing was driving cars shoot around grab guns from police and military and running away from them...Tried to explore building but all was closed (99%of it).I played a little bit of mission goals but that was boring after 6 7 mission. Then changing the characters?Don't know what is that good for I hate that already from resident evil.It is a huge world but somehow dead (except you can drive cars shoot at people fight with the police)But hey i saw it now and i played Dying Light &amp Just Cause 3 before and the world there is so much alive and much more interesting more fun to play. Going back there Sayonara!Would like to recommend the game but can't do that 'cos most of the time i fight police to take their guns/ammot???And online part isn't really playable according to already existing comments.Can't recommend your game becasue of that...
Story. Good. Company. Bad.
Hobbes was right.
JOHN MARSTON can be your ing dad in multiplayer mode!!! THATS ING INSANE!!! 10000/10
Got to the top 12 in my first hour of play really compelling game. Very easy to get a hang of and very compelling gameplay. Great alone and better with friends.
Rocket League is a fun and unique game where you play soccer but with a TWIST... you play with CARS! In Rocket League you can play ranked or unranked which is a ranking system from the highest rank to the lowest rank. You can get items to customize your car and even get different types of cars such as a boost wheels topper(hat) and many different skins and for the items you dont want you can trade with other players to get something better or if you have 5 of the same type of item ( Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Import Body Exotic And of course mystery decal) then you can trade it in for one item of a higher rarity. But beware of scammers! You can also train in the exhibiton or go there just for some fun! You can also buy crates which is a random item which could possibly be a mystery decal. And it's under 20$!!!! I definitely recommend this to anyone that like soccer or cars or BOTH and even if you dont like those 2 things it's still a really good game and i highly recommend you check it out NOW!!!
There is a bit of a learning curve to start and the game has it's fair share of toxic people but there are plenty of friendly ones as well.
Very good! Very Nice!
DA BEST!
With all the new content they keep on adding into the game deffintly worth the buy
This game was awesome. i really like it.. its really colorful..play this game like back being a kid again.... but i still get a problem. every time i play about 20 30 minutes the game freeze it self.... that because game bug or because my amd rx 470 problem ?? by the way 10/10 reccomended this game...
Fun. Addictive Great with friends
Very cool game!
The game wont even open im on a mac and every time i open it it crashes.
didnt think this would be a game for me but was pleasantly suprised
Amazingly addictive game I played it for the first time straight for 8 hours.
its pretty fun especially with friends P
Dont like soccer games dont like driving games love this game honestly fav game on steam. Losing is fun wining is fun and some match are so close it makes me belive i need to stop playing and see a masuse!
game ran fine after the first couple months of purshase but now its almost unplayable. can i get a refund?
What about it? It's ace.
gift this game to a friend left for dead by your friend
Great game really whizzy
Not much to say this game is one hell of a game.The Grand Theft Auto series will always be the Ex Libris of Open World games. GTA V makes justice to its predecessors.
Dobra k'o kruh da ti ja sad reknem.
best game to play with friends ....better than H1Z1....love to play PUBG....
i absolutly love this game but on my laptop the load times are unrealingame causing building to not load
Battle Royale at its best and most realistic.
"Update 9/5/2017 *Sigh* Extremely buggy and horribly optimized. Honestly if you got AMD you might not want to waste your time. Spend too many hours staring at wikis and tech sites figuring out how to get it to run right. AMD already announced if you have an RX 400 series card don't even use this games msaa causing too many issues. Oh yeah Online is cheater infested as always. If you get this don't buy it for $60 check out those ""other stores""Update 6/18/2017 You killed the community that has kept your games alive since 2001 and even made an online component before you ever did. This is not how a company should treat its fans fans who have even gained real life jobs in game development from testing and practicing safe singleplayer modding in your games. I am highly dissapointed in Take Two Interactive and their CEO Strauss Zelnick. As for Rockstar I know they make the calls not you I just hope at some point Zelnick steps down and somehow this can all be fixed. Probably won't be for years seeing as how much money he has made and even insisted he isn't making as much as he could in an interview. So saddened to see a community that has bonded together since the late 90's fall apart like this. Update 3/19/2017 THIS GAME WILL NOT RUN CORRECTLY FOR ANYONE 8/10 TIMES. YOU WILL FREEZE STUTTER AND SEE THE WHOLE WORLD GO INVISIBLE. DO NOT BUY UNTIL FIXED.Update 12/30/2016 If you are an I5 processor user this game will have massive compatibility issues for you. It won't be unplayable but you will have to drop down to the lowest settings to run it smooth. Wait for a update fix before buying if you are an I5 user.Also there is a new mod menu that is spreading like crazy as the creator made it publicly usable don't know why. Thats why the false claims of ""Rockstar banned me and I did nothing."" are all over the place. So be warned that GTAO is currently modder infested.ORIGINAL REVIEW Odds are you already played this on console. If you liked it then you'll like it now with better graphics and actually above 25fps online. Just watch out for modders most want to mess with u or kill the whole lobby repeatedly with your name attached and get you vote kicked out the lobby. Other than that its a great game. HOWEVER the last update messed up optimization for a lot of people I'm getting way more frame drops and stuttering setting the game to high or realtime priority in task manager did help some but issues still arise."
Death simulator?
This game is honestly the best $20 I've ever spent. 500 Hours spent in this game. Every hour has been fun!
!
merge
All I have to say is that its a great game fun mechanics and it provides alot of customization. There is alot of depth to the jumps arials and boost management. There is the BEST soundtrack for a game Ive heard EVER BUT The community is among the iest I have ever seen. Its gotten to a point where coming across a decent person is rare and an coming to ME is too common. And sure anyone can take but when its every game? Thats where I draw the line. This could be just me idk but that was my expiriance. Though I highly recommend it 8/10 wow! wow! wow! wow! wow! what a save! what a save!

Product received for free. good
I first downloaded Rocket League on the PS4 because it was free for PS+ members. Since playing on the PS4 and enjoying it so much I felt so bad that I got the game for free that I had to come over and pay full price on Steam for it. Yeah I know the devs get some cheese from Sony for the PS+ promos but still. Rocket League is a beautiful fast and fun pick up and play arcade style sports game. The controls are simple enough that you'll feel like a badass playmaker your first game or so. Oh and the addition of local co op and cross platform play is really nice to see too.
game is not a good the are not a 20 be
I can't even play online keeps on saying that the files can't be downloaded
This game is boring
Banning modding? That's a no from me Jack.
super
omg u start out naked so funny tehe
I do like the game it is only really fun with friends. Too many trollsThe graphics are alright the sounds are decent the gameplay is nice and all of the features work well together. but problem is you will have wait for so long to find a lobby so i hope they will fix it soon. other than that Game is great never get bored )
https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv I may not play this game very often and there's a good reason for that. Campaign didn't interest me bu the multiplayer did now that it's basically fallen to the hackers I can't enjoy it anymore. I've thought about doing some fun things to the singleplayer to at least enjoy the game I purchased but I guess I can't do that anymore and I refuse to join the hackers. Please sign it and help people who did nothing wrong get something they love to do back. Currently switching this to a positive... for now. Rockstar is trying to do its best by the looks of things to make take two get the broom out of their and stop going after singleplayer mods and to focus on those who's modding the online experience in the game that's hurting players. (IE Taking their guns and money and stuff like that.) So it's a thumbs up for Rockstars sake they're apart of this just as much as Take Two and shouldn't have to suffer for this Rep Bombing they're getting.
Got banned for literally no reason at all never modded the game or anything. Just out of the blue
Oh yeah. Oh my friends! We did it! Well you did it. I know I didn t do that much but you you oh you! You know I thought you were just a bunch of er creepy quite weirdos.

The best game ever
Here is my review for GTA V (Single Player)PROS Open world with very big map which you can explore and do many many things from side quests to activities. Stunning graphics. Excellent voice acting. The music is as usual in GTA game good. Easy gameplay A live city the Ai was very well made. You can do almost anything you want from watching TV playing golf parachuting going to strip club buying various properties or even wreaking havoc in the city! The main story was although nothing extraordinary solid and good FANTASTIC main characters each one with his pros and cons in his character. Even if you finish the game you can just play it from time to time for fun doing whatever you like. You can customize your vehicles at a great extent something that i really liked.Cons You cant have a proper girlfriend like previous GTA. Although the cops are more challenging than previous GTA and thats good sometimes it becomes a nuisance to escape them. Rockstar's move before the summer sale to increase the price was HORRIBLE and it stopped 3 of my friends from buying it.Online is really enjoyable but i stopped playing because there were too many jackasses that attack you for no reason epxloding your car etc making the gameplay frustrating for me.
Huge map with a lot to explore. I am eager to see updates with more weapons and vehicles. Different house layouts and more interaction with the waterways would be nice. I also want more options to use my rewards points. My crates have rest back to the first one twice now.
Nice

Plays well currently lack optimization but will or should be fixed in future Versions. so far it is a Really fun exp but play with friends it makes it eaiser and Alot more Fun D
great game but always connection lost .
You can't choose between maps (i like more the old map btw) the servers are full of cheaters. this game
Just Right
The game has really took a turn for the worst
Monster Hunter on PC? CheckRemoving all the tedious item management crafting from previous MH games? CheckSeamless zone transitions? CheckGreat game overall. Exactly what Monster Hunter should have been the whole time.
Love This Game *_* Best Game To Play With Friends )
Okay story mode. Good open world. Excellent gameplay and graphics. Still a five year old game though. Shouldn't have the full release price tag even if it goes on sale often.Monetization out the in Online. Either grind for hundreds of hours or pay up .Hackers galore and innocent players being banned after having modded money forced upon them.
This game is freaking amazing! It is so much fun! Especially when you play with friends! The developers really listen to the players which is great! People give it so many bad reviews for bugs and yes there are bugs but at least for me they don t occur that often and the developers always try and fix them as soon as possible. I mean it s hard not to have bugs in a game like this with how huge the map is and everything but this game is definitely worth the money and it s amazing!
My third leg is HUGE 10/10
give agent to tencent you all familiy earn my money betray us players kkkkkkkkkkkk uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Certainly worth a play when discounted during a sale (not sure how I feel about full price).Key things to bear in mind * you'll feel better about the griefers when you consider them the human equivalent of the AI zombies in a zombie game. It's okay to be killed and robbed and actual players are far funnier about it.* don't walk in with the initial idea that it's going to be a building game. You'll invest a whole bunch of time in gathering resources and then just have them stolen. Your base will be broken into as soon as you log out.* make a sleeping bag and hide it somewhere so you can keep spawning at the same location and start to learn the surrounding area. You can also use sleeping bags to bring in other players to your location by donating it to them.* spend your first couple of plays collecting items from barrels and earning knowledge.* play with others go solo and you'll have a very hard time.* play with voice comms enabled it's fun to interact with the other dodgy survivalists.
Absolute t what 2k have done to forge. These greedy can off! This game is not worth buying as it is a microtransaction hell hole that is impossible to enjoy without shoveling money down 2ks fat greedy ing mouths.
Makes you cry alot
Developer's decide they have better things to do like make more money than actually making the game stable. Constant server trouble invite system is buggy and in game play is buggy.

This game suffers from a wide range of issues HUGE grind as well as a large amount of hackers &amp toxic players. Singleplayer itself is rather alright though it's a bit lacking in activities.I'll focus on some things hurting the game (primarily Online) Possibly one of the most toxic online communities nowadays. Expect people to use the most OP / cheesy ways to kill you including a hitscan RPG. More about that later. Connection issues disconnecting game moving you to a different server and away from your friends you just played with. Very long loading times it's often faster to load into single player and then multiplayer than straight into multiplayer. Also those long loading times continue even after you got into multiplayer and are just hopping between gamemodes heck they don't have to start. All that needs to prompt a load is you accepting an invite into a game lobby (more precisely waiting room) You can't use Steam Overlay when loading because said loading will simply pause. Bad and laggy melee combat system. Hackers. There's lots of them and they have HUGE range of abilities you think an enemy constantly spawning in a jet (which normally takes time to get is very powerful and can be super difficult to take down) is annoying? Well I hope you don't meet hackers who can kick you out of the session or crash your game by spawning dozens of clothes on you. Limited clothes. Rockstar has been improving itself when it came to clothing adding some new models with every larger update (although they still never added the objects available for all three main characters in singleplayer). However those clothes are often of poor texture quality and aren't available in all colours. You like red? Well that's a shame we only have pitch black white brown navy blue camo desert camo forest camo and two hideous mixes. Also don't expect to make your entire outfit match the green you have on your sweater will most likely be different from the one on your cap. Also the game is really strict on what you can wear with what for example you can wear this jacket with these shirts but not with those shirts or you can wear a scarf with pink tanktop but not with black tanktop. Car customization is a bit eeh in the game. Many cars aren't very customizable the best thing you can do in many of them is lengthen the sides by a couple of centimeters. Some cars aren't customizable at all and you can't even put them in your normal garage. Heists are pretty damn boring. They're nothing like in Singleplayer where you have multiple approaches places to set up your escape vehicles et cetera et cetera. In GTA Online heists are pretty much standard missions with some story behind them you don't have a choice in how to go through with the mission. Also if somebody leaves during a heist everyone will drop out. Combine that with the connection issues and you'll see the possible infuriation. At least the stories and cutscenes are fun.. Things are extremely expensive (up to several millions) in order to 'encourage' people to buy Shark Cards AKA cards giving you in game currency for real money. In reality you get little currency for huge amount. You need to grind a lot for money.. or find a hacker who will simply spawn millions for you to pick up. Though you're likely to get banned even if you never intended to pick up any money that the hacker spawned on you. GTA V uses a level (rank) system for its weapons so you'll be able to unlock specific weapons at specific levels. ...Except that they added free widely available DLCs which add the best weapons (stat wise) to purchase with no rank restrictions. There's a complete lack of balance not even an attempt at it. Aside from the aforementioned nonsense with the levels Rockstar started with things like fast bullet proof vehicles and eventually reached explosive bullets which can be applied to a sniper rifle creating a hitscan RPG that I mentioned. Perfect for killing players with one shot to the big toe. Their customer support is infamous for being useless even in really urgent cases like having your account stolen. If they reply to you then their bot will copy paste you a useless response about how bans are permament when you asked for something else. Rockstar releases huge content patches which you need to pay tons of money to get into. CEO update? Pay at least a million for an office then few hundred thousand for a warehouse. You also have to pay for crates which are the main missions in this update. Oh yeah randoms can completely destroy all your progress during the final mission when you sell said crates. They're even encouraged to attack you. The recent Gunrunning upgrade allows you to conduct research in order to get things like weapon mods (including the explosive ammunition for the Hitscan RPG mentioned above). Research takes.. 4 real life hours I believe? You need to be online through it all and you need to keep your supply meter high you either buy those or steal them (AKA do a mission one that takes place in the full lobby so everyone can attack you while you're doing it other players even get a ping to let them know about you!). There are 45 research upgrades that means 7.5 days of playtime. Of course you can speed up the research with sweet $$$ and what better way to get it than with Shark Cards! Oh the research is random too you do not get to pick what you want to get next. Oh yeah Singleplayer doesn't get anything. Not even the many vehicles that appear Online. Rockstar likes to patch stuff! Especially if by 'stuff' I mean harmless glitches that for example allow you to equip a mask with a hat something you can't do normally and yet it looks perfectly fine no clipping or anything. Having lower graphics specifically ones that change the amount of nature puts you at a gigantic advantage. Having said option put to lowest absolutely removes grass which can be rather high in this game leading to situations in which you get headshotted by someone you couldn't see behind it all. There are also some facts like that Rockstar fooled customers by raising the price of GTA V when Steam Summer Sale 2015 started (so the discount it got was equivalent to its standard price of 59 99 ). Not only that they included Shark Cash Card. Said Shark Cash Card gives you in game money. Sounds pretty sweet right? Except that it counts as a redeemed DLC the moment you get it which means that you wouldn't be able to get a refund for GTA V because of it.In 2017 of course there was the fiasco with making mods illegal.All in all singleplayer which I didn't focus a lot on as it's rather okay has a nice story likeable characters although it's lacking in activities and is very unlikely to receive any sort of story enhancing DLCs. Online is terrible imbalanced toxic and Rockstar's greedy attempts at taking more money aren't helping the game as a whole. If you're not sure whether to get it or not ask yourself if you have friends to play with because trying to find yourself in the community will be problematic. Don't get it just for the singleplayer. And don't get it for full price.It's a shame really at its core GTA is a super fun game but everything Rockstar built on top of it only dragged it further down and down.
Good game. Simple mechanics easy to use but hard to fully master.
Now i can touch balls as much as i want to. 3 my life long dream is complete
Lagging in Asia server Indians and Nepalese don't buyYou will regret I can't get a refundBecause I was afk
It's a really fun game people can get really creative with their moves and their cars also it seems to be one of the few genuinely rare cross platform games. It's definitely great to play with friends online or on the couch which I think is a great feature. Definitely worth sale if not full price!
This game is and for NOOBS
Best Monster Hunter Game ever.
Its doesnt get any better. Ive purchased this game at full retail three times and dont regret it.
If I could customize my character that would be great. Also can't get a significant amount of fps to run at 144hz with a 1500x. The game itself is fine but a few changes would make it better.
So chinese ads and false stream sniper bans... Good job BlueHole you made people hate your poorly optimized game even more.
cooks my hardware while looking like sh*t. awful netcode lots of trust in the client resulting in easy cheats.
i like it
Pick this game up NOW! It is one of the most addicting games I have played in years. So simple yet being good is really hard. I heartily recommend this game!
I just want the rain back

Great game ruined by greed and removal of modding support. 0/10 wouldn't buy again
very slow game
awesome game
Only played one day so far but wow. It's amazing!You know how you play a game and you now you're gonna play it off and on for the rest of your life? I got that feeling with this game.
best game ever
Very fun and enjoying game
I've had the game for a few months now and have already almost put 1k hours on it. love the game!
Very fun &amp addicting! Highly recommend for those who like Battle Royale.
I liked the idea of it being a game where you can create a small town with other people to survive the elements of the game but instead it's full of toxic ***holes that just kill you and it's everything I hate about the gaming community in one neat little package.
This game has come so far so fast. Is it the madden killer yet? Of course not. But it does have the best customization options in a sports video game ive ever seen. I was able to create a team with full custom uniforms and logos in just an hour after learning the basics. Roster customization is also very easy. This series can very easily be the future madden killer with the right funding. The developers are constantly updating based off player feedback and the series looks promising as a whole. Don't expect a madden level depth of content but rather a fun and infinitly customizable survival experience. And for $20 this game is a massive steal.
"I had enough Lagging and Bugging in 3 hours for a ""finished"" game. I want my money back.+ Gameplay which is more than average Bugs/Lags which are more than annoying"
good
Don't let the negative reviews of potential cheaters and game breakers fool you this is an excellent game. Everything about it is smooth immersive and engaging. There's more content than you can shake a stick at and hundreds and hundreds of hours worth of gameplay to enjoy whether in story mode or playing online. People are upset because the game developers want people to play the game as intended instead of changing it drastically for entertainment purposes. Look at what OpenIV has done they changed the game SO much that now there are hundreds of people bad mouthing the game simply because they can't modify the game to their liking anymore. If OpenIV hadn't come along and tarnished an otherwise flawless product GTA V would still be a gleaming example of what a game should be. Instead it is losing players and the reputation of GTA V is being damaged beyond repair. Here's a big **** You to OpenIV for causing this.Sincerely A True Gamer
The game was fun until the banned me for no reason...
Awesome game to play with friends! I really liked old Rust and now I like new too. Really recommend!
Awsome
The gameplay is awesome. Maps (both) are maybe too big and circles moves a bit too slow. If you're a w4nker the game can be extremely long which is boring and there are obviously many w4nkers in this game i myself i have way too much ADHD so i cannot wait like that.Pro awesome game so much tactical stuff it requires aiming skills af which i really like especially the bulletdrop which makes everything even more realistic.Cons A lot of w4nkers WAY too many russkis give them a region so they can speak their demonic language freely. And here comes the nuclear bomb. The worst thing in this game is the optimization. It is so bad. My computer should have atleast 70/80 fps but it doesn't. I've heard that players with 1080 i76000s and 16gb memory are struggling as well. That simply makes no sense even though it a big map and everything. So if you have a sucky PC don't buy it because you'll have a bad experience even though the game is good. FRUSTRATION is the key to avoid in this game D.Overall i like it but i will not continue to play it if they won't optimize the game it simply runs so bad.
Banning modes is racistSAY NO TO RACISM!
Would not recommend. The 5 hours I have of game time was me completing the storymode and partially completing the online turtorials just to play with some friends online (which i did for all of 10 minutes). The fustration and time spent was not worth it.If i could i would refund this game.
love playing this game!
Супер! Балдею каждый день!
I found it far too confusing to even get started in this game and I feel there should be the option for Single Player. No fun was had here.
666
I have played this game for a while now. Not really sure what the draw is to this game by so many. I could play this game for 1000hrs and still have the same as the new guy? (crates dont count) I do enjoy the game and after playing fortnight for free I can confirm **THIS** game is worth money in comparison. I have seen a few hackers but there are really good players in here as well so dont cry when you die. The developers are doing a good job of continuing to bring more content to the game for free. Overall I would say yes I recommend this game to any of my friends. It had its share of trouble in BETA but its not in beta anymore and the full release is faily solid.
Using the trash Steam servers isn't a good idea! You got 50 minutes for a mission and steam disconnects/restarts 4 times within this period of time. No auto reconnect function to set up a new SOS flare... dis shid!!
"Product received for free. well where do i start XDThe game is great after i spent a couple of hours playing i only won 1 game after try harding but i think most guns are even non are OP it just depends how you use the gun.Not much toxic people only when your waiting in the lobby (you either hear people shouting ""China number 1) or some racist dude.This game is better than fortnite as you dont have to build walls or build a little house to camp in.The game makes you think on what to do its not really just run in and kill its pretty tectical.you dont need to win games to have fun getting to the top 5 is always fun and you can learn from your mistakes.Not much more to say but i recommend buying this but not for 26.99 wait for sale or buy of CD.Keys.Enjoy"
This is worth buying 9.9/10I wish this had an offline mode with bots that would be really fun when i go travelling and i have no internetif there is an offline mode kindly comment on this review that would be really great
Product received for free. WHY YOU CLOSED OPEN IV!?!?!?!?!?!
Meh kinda generic
This game is very fun if you like to grind get money and then spending it. But every thing is so expensive so sometimes is boring but if you like a sanbox game you should like this game.
Good game. WIll be even better once they fix the bugs and get out of early access.
Dear Developer i'm not enjoying this game you have a big update in this game. but other country is slow internet to 3 days to success this update and i hope parthnership your Game in valve for permanet ban who player cheating this games and buy again this lets waste the money.sorry badenglish hahaha
Playerunknown's Battleground has a lot of interesting features that makes the game very immersive. For starters if you joke about kicking someone in the mouth IRL while playing this game you might get banned. This features let's you really feel like you're a part of the game and is a whole new take on modern gaming.Vehicles is very realistic. For example if you're driving on a dirt road and hit a small pebble you have a 50/50% chance to go from 60mph to a dead stop or just randomly take damage. As looting and parachuting as of now is all skill based and no RNG is involved what so ever I feel this was a nescessary step for the developers to take just so the skill roof can be lowered a little bit.BrownHole has also been very good at balancing the game. A few patches ago there was a huuuge improvement to the very overpowered performance imbalance. Many players with good computers suddenly experienced a huge FPS boost which I guess BrownHole thought was not fair for players with not so good computers so they implemented a few new memory leaks to the maps so you could not get a stable 60fps+ so it's fair for those who is rendering the game at ultra LOW settings.All in all this game feels very smooth if you generally don't mind a game that goes from 120fps out in the field to 30fps when you are about to engage a cowering foe in the city.This game does NOT feel like it's still an Early Access title and I'm thinking the developers did a good job finishing the game before they released it.Would recommend to friends? Yes. (Not really I'd rather eat my own off).
It's like FIFA if FIFA sucked less. With cars.10/10.Very simple concept but a very fun game nonetheless. Gets addictive 20 minutes in. You don't have to like football/soccer to love this game. You can play with keyboard but i suggest a controlerFlaws matchmaking sometimes sucks.
everything is perfect .
Its a good game but it gets boring!
There is more wrong with the game than right as of now it is no way worth the asking price.
not having fun on this game
THis game is good but there is way to many hackers. Please fix this.
I found this game is not that fun. I play both as a hunter and as a surviver. Each time the macth making system take a new persoin to the game like me and though them at high tier player making this game to be unplayable. This game does have its moments of some fun but over all it needs alot of work so save your money.
fun to play
It is very fun to play. If you are reading this I know you want it so buy it!
lit game
Yes.Still yes.
Singleplayer Load into game fast as hell.Story was interesting not too difficult and fun. Plus you can mod it however you like for more hours of replay.Multiplayer For a game that sold about 32 500 000 copies and made 3.5 BILLION in 2014 DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE DAMN LOADING TIME.Modders ruin the game by forking you in the till you die and repeat. If you wanna setup a heist by yourself goodluck because either other players are impatient or they are just trying to hop into a room for the finale.Throws tons of new contents BUT it's ganna cost you. You can either grind your off or buy shark cards (You probably figure which one R* want you to do).GTA V Online is only bearable to play when you got friends.

This game is absolutly terrible. Nothing but peekers and campers and cheaters. Give me a game like Quake or Unreal Tournament over this garbage. Only buy it if you are a cheater too.
I absolutely reccomend this game to all my friends it is so much fun
This game is epic. I bought it like 2 or 3 days ago and I'm in love with it. I recommend it for anyone who wants to have a good time while enjoying multiplayer!
this awful made game. So many bugs and devs dont care.
23 hours of game play in 2 days..... my girlfriend hates me.... oops
A good game with good graphics who is very good to learn about real lifes struggles to P (community level)
The game itself is pretty fun but they've recently destroyed the modding community for both online and offline play. The new content they add is only accessible online which wouldn't be the worst thing ever but it is locked behind insane prices that would require hours of tedious grinding if you wanted to gather up enough funds. ...or you know you can buy Sharkcards and get a fraction of the content that they put out. For $100 you would get 8 million in game currency which won't even get you very far. You might be able to get a few of the vehicles or the special facilities that they seem to keep locking content behind. To put things into perspective 8 million in game currency isn't even enough to buy the most expensive yacht in the game and the yachts don't really even do that much for you. So Rockstar seems to think that their virtual yacht (you can't even drive it) is worth over 100 dollars.
blast
I really liked the games story back in the day but the multiplayer is plain chaos. Hackers Massacres Pay2HaveFun Needs friends to do something (dont have any)
game is don't bother playing it
GTA onlline does all the money
Rush B always
You know if you'd do something with the single player aspect of this game we wouldn't need mods to enjoy it. Oh wait...no shark cards to buy there so you don't give two s about it. Avoid.
A few updates ago the game completely messed up survive with friends to find a match. YOU CANT FIND A GAME WITH A FRIEND WITHIN 12 MINUTES OF SEARCHING.And also some games it disconnects survivors from the match saying the host disconnected but the host really didn't.
i love the br mode. i think the engine choice was bad and a lot of silly game design decisions thin down the true br experience. not worth the money and time
great open world game lots of fun.
Its a Grand Theft Auto Game so of coruse its good and worth your money 10/9
This is good in general but rockstar is I got banned for nothing i lost around 50 000 000 and when i could play again i got around 4 000 000 and nothing els i needed to creat a new careackter and i thing rockstar should do something about the banning system.
Fast paced Day Z with slightly less glitches
hi
mmmm so tasty!
Best game ever !! &lt 3
at it
This game has BALLS! and cars.
"Keep getting the error ""bad_module_info has stopped working "" anyone know how to fix this issue? It's getting a bit ridiculous."
Undoubtably a very fun and well developed game.The weekly updates keep you intrigued and continue to improve the graphical and gameplay aspects of the game. Plenty of modded and community made servers so you can play a server exactly how you like it (solo only no craft times multiplied resources etc).That being said it's a game that will induce a lot a rage after losing hours of work if you are killed/raided and is definitely 100% best played with friends as a group/clan.
You did the right thing. We had too put a gun to your head. But you still did the right thing.
We're talking about lucky now
This game is Sweg!!!
This is best game!!!
Played since CBT week 2 Nothing bad to say. Great battle royale game. 5/5
Loading Screen sim for me! for ex u can do ur homework or some while u trying to join online. Still 1 of the best multiplayer games with open world
Grind Theft Auto V
this game was fun when it was knew. id say i only encountered minor bugs. nothing to big or game breaking. i can get past bugs honestly. but this that they have done is a ing joke! im surprised they have not put a pay wall to get into the plane. nothing will change unless everybody stops paying for this and boycotts the game.
Still one of the best games in the series Grand Theft AutoMy score 10 of 10
i love this game
God damn is this good. This is more or less crack.The combination of cars and soccer works so perfectly its a wonder that this game has not appeared earlier than it did. Get it ASAP you HAVE to try it.Perfect 5/7.
Great game but very hard to master.Fun game but rage inducing.Competitive yet sometimes easy going and relaxing.
New killer is pretty much a bag of But you can throw a rock as a survivor. much wow such
Sweet game
most toxic game ive ever played
Love it one of my favorite games of all time!
Must play. Instense when playing the survivor but more fun playing the killer. Come join us.
Even though the game isn't fully optimised it's still a great fun game.
Aimbot hackers tp hackers flying hackers suicide hackers resource hackers. You name it Rust will give you all them! Not worth wasting your time on it wait til they fix the bugs and get rid of the hackers. Released the game wayyyyyyy to soon
it's ok
It's one of those reviews where you wish there was a mixed review option.
The bullet holes all stay the shells on the ground stay and the magazines you dropped after murdering someone for their stuff is just amazing. Great game. Should update the 7.62 rounds to go through the house walls. Great start to an early release game. R.I.P KING OF THE HILL H1Z1 LOL
desperately needs a public lobby system. trying to play with friends is a nightmare. would not recomend in its current state.
Holy ban people who are hacking already. 4 games running I've died to people with aim bots.
10/10 amazing game wolud recomend to pepol wth tme on there hands because you will need 2 hour play seations
Big waste of time but its fun
ti sukcs boals cuz i cannot stansfer my akkount from ps quad to here pc. otherwouise it pretti kood.
Best survival fps out there awesome awesome awesome!
Product received for free. Greatest Battle Royale Game !!! So interest
This is a 10/10 game. I have easily put 700 hours into this game and I will put in 700 more! Then 700 more! There's not much I can say besides get this game! Worth it.Edit Just updating my review. I still think it's a 10/10 game. I even have 3700+ hours at the time of this edit which is 1600 more hours than I said I would have total when I said I would add 700 more and 700 more again.
Great Game work in progress but lots of fun!
Like the game but Rockstar do so little to combat modders and hackers and the game is poorly optimised. Devs that are a 1000 times smaller than Rockstar can make a more solid online game so it deserves a negative review.
Great Game but you get banned from ALL matchmacking for 15 minutes if you leave ranked match even if your teammate isn't even playing. You should only be banned from ranked not open play.
Beautiful GraphicsStartup A bit slow but after that it runs pretty smooth
"When I first saw this game I was like ""This here game is like Minecraft but in 3D"" so I took the chances and bought it.But man oh man was I wrong this game was nothing like Minecraft!So esentially Rust is a game for online multiplayer only now that may seem bad but thats what it is your suppose to team up or go solo dont quit the game because when you do look for a hiding spot or someone might kill you esentially it wants you to spend tons of time on the dang game. But theres a catch you have a feeling of staying alive well in other games you also do but this game makes you scared when your mom comes over and screams to go to dinner your forced to log off all the time at dinner your wonder pondering if you are still alive and when you get back to the computer and you see your still alive whew your so relived. In Rust its a game about survival no minigames no nothing just survive. You can build houses making yourself hidden to all other players where will you live? In the open? Or in the mountains? Rust takes the feeling of the movie Lost where all you can do is make normal things such as stone hatchets pickaxes and.... Guns?! Thats right in Rust you can make guns while the process isn't as hard as say Watchdogs getting a $40 000 gun its still pretty hard to get some high tech stuff. While the game is still in its alpha stages I'd love to see what they will add in the game in the near future. Thats all for my review of Rust."
my game doesnt work!! i want my money back
Great game and always improving with great updates! Make sure you have some friends playing with you!
Game is of course very good indeed. Everybody should give it a try!P.S. New hunter here and I am thrilled 10/10
Pretty good job so far!
This game requires a LOT of determination. You get started you get raided you make a play get by a naked charging you with a rock because of the games optimization causing you to lag. Did I mention rusts poor construction? The game has 10 year old software in it and it is not working very well (slow loading times and poor performance). Even known this is a positive review rust is a bad game but it is sure as hell addicting. You will eventually gain up to 1k hours on the game and realizing you have no life anymore then you will start fanning rust skins and skull ing you bank account. The rust community is 50 50half toxic and half sane. One you get passed all that you find ways around it and you will be out of that and being a god at rust making plays raiding clans wiping zergs all that good and at that point you realize the suffering was worth it.
Worth it
This game is very fun. One of my favourite features is that you can add attachments to weapons unlike H1Z1 KOTK.Also I feel as if PUBG is more realistic which personally gets me on the edge of my seat where as H1Z1 has a m ore Arcade type feeling to it.One of my least favourite things about PUBG is that because its a relatively new release and in early access it doesnt have much to it other than trying to become last man standing. New rank feature on leaderboards and if you do end up becoming the last man standing the rewards are pretty pathetic (couple of hundred coins). Other than that its a great game. Dont be worrying about what I said negatively as this can be fix in further updates and as the game progresses.
Capcom's first MonterHunter game on PC this game game is really fun there is a lot to learn in the game I m still learning and evolving as a hunter and would highly recommended this game to anyone especially those who appreciate action RPGs with good build diversity plenty of customisation and depth.
nice gameplay.. hope get collaboration with ps4 for the horizon event
I love this game so much that it gives me the chills to sometimes remind me that its okay to play alone and to survive alone. hmmp Irdk if its only me but I compare myself to this game and its somehow relatable but its so good buying the game was so much the worth thanks for that sale. and ohh about the game try it. highly recommended ))
Game is great except you have to deal with the very slow loading screen. Usually spent most of my time on loading screens lol
everytime i switch to trev his eating out of a trash can.
CAPCOM!!!! I NEED RE 3 REMAKE. IT'S SO GOOD DUDE WHY ARE YOU READDING THIS AND NOT BUYING THE GAME? DO IT DO IT NOW. 4K 60fps with an GTX 1070 and Ryzen 1400 at 3.8Ghz if you want to know how is the port btw.
Great multiplayer survival game.This game is more of a Survival Battle Royale and it actually takes time and skill.It's not like Fortnite where you can just move your mouse left click and kill someone.This game is worth the money and with whats in store for the future of Rust.9/10Some bugs but they aren't gamebreaking or anything.
KONTOOOLLLLL!!!! Ni game susah amat nyari RP sama duitnya kyk nyari serbuk micin di dalem jembudgua laporin rockstar ke ka seto ni biar di cabulin!KENGENTOTAN YANG HAQQ
This game is very addictive. You start out and suck and constantly try to get better then something clicks and you start playing great. I love this game. Rocket Cars forever
Outstanding game and I recommend picking it up
Very interesting after 51hours of playing. I m really addicted to it. You should try it when it s on sale especially when you have friends. Encountered modders or cheaters sometimes but just don t let them ruin your game enjoying cause you can simply change to another session when they try to destroy your day. Hope I d never meet any kinds of money dropping in the future! Strongly recommend to you!
Very good game in all modes split screen (very rare today) local and online.Challenging but balanced even young kids can play in local mode without frustration.Controller is highly recommended but game is still very playable with keyboard and mouse.Will run on new notebooks with integrated video (40 FPS 1280x1024 high details 33 FPS 1920x1080 high performance).Streams fine with SHIELD tabletDrawbacks are minor and easy to live with 1. Multiple controllers are highly recommended to play properly2. Looks like game tries to optimise performance and sets resolution limit depending on hardware need to change it3. Split screen for more than 2 players not very playable even on 1900x1080
whenever i play the black guy the police are always chasing mejust like real life then
So this is the newest patchnote Added cracked bells mossy rubble piles and a new cap on the central palace in Ruins. Enhanced the look of cliffs and rocks mapwide. Fixed an issue where the crossbow's reticles were misaligned. Fixed an issue where some terrain in Sanhok could be passed through. Fixed a few objects in Sanhok and Miramar that obstructed character movement. Thats five(!!!!) new or improved things and they want me to download 6.6 Gb??? ARE YOU ING KIDDING ME???? seriously don't buy this game shi thole is making it worse and worse ...
Its gooddon't really know what else to say.
After completing the single player story modding is the only fun thing left to do with this game..... after Rockstar/Take2 decided to plow everying into the terrible toxic boring as hell online multiplayer side of the game. How about instead of attacking the people who are making your game better you actually create more solo player missions like so many people want you to do? There's clearly a huge demand for it.
i liked the type of game that it shows on Your First Day. i think it was a lot better
Really fun game especially when you have a couple of friends to play it with. A large variety of servers although the server searching seems a little bit buggy at times (nothing major) you can still manage to get into a server eventually and be disapointed at how small your is in the game.I really enjoy it.
Best Car game D
Amazing game recommended 100% great time playing it meet amazing people
Very fun game. Can't wait for it to be finished
I have a couple hundred hours on Rust now and with the new blueprint plus component system in the game people aren't giving the game enough credit. There are some problems they need to fix but the dev team said that they will fix them very soon they just wanted to have this update released. To be honest I love this update because it is way harder to get end game items and we get to think up new creative ways of raiding and building without certain blueprints.
It's okay (what I said after I looked up and 6 hours had passed)
huva peli voi ajaa prätkää ja vetää bäkkärin
This is amazing!Think back to search and destroy in MW2 or CS GO. But on a scale battlefield has only dreamed of.
Wow great game definitly suggest. 10/4 would buy again... if it was on sale........ never is though. Great even for high price. Buy this gaMe.
Good game ( ʖ )
Great Company Great Community Great Game
theres just so much time for activities
Worth the pre order on console had some issues on PC at first but both versions fully caught my attention the entire time I've been playing. This is my first introduction to the series and was well worth every cent.
very good game
You know that one minigame in some car based games from the PS2 era? This is that on another level. FIFA Cars. 10/10.
holy yes
"Wow. Does this game ever have a nice single player I gotta say other than the tediousness lack of check points sometimes it's very very good! However the thing that I bought this game for! Online! The iest servers in the ing universe D! Boy do I ever love trying to play with my friends! To bad it takes 10 minutes to do so! Please don't give me ""You probably have internet or a crappy computer"" because I have very good internet and a very good pc. If this isn't good enough it's not my above average hardware that I use to play games with daily it's rockstar... They managed to optimize the game super well I get very good frames but to bad it takes 5 minutes at the least to start playing the game I understand it has a huge world but if I use an example say skyrim (a game that came out 2011) has a giant world and Gta came out 2 years later with a smaller world by the looks of it to me skyrim takes about 2 minutes to load in for me...Now here is my biggest issue. Every ing heist Lamar missions and anything else that forces 4 people. I know that rockstar wants you to play with your friends but if one of them time out boom you just wasted another 5 30 minutes depending on how far you are and if you're like me half the time you don't have 4 friends to play with so it's a random who is either nice and will understand your mistakes and his mistakes or you get mr. who judges you for dying once then goes ahead and runs into the battle field with the ing OP enemies and gets killed in 2 seconds because it's on hard and you actually want to play the game for the good parts of it so you try to make money. But he decides to leave and you're stuck here having to do the tedious heist setup or what ever again... all to make a 1/5 of a 100 thousand dollars which is about a 1/10 away from a good car! 1 good car! THE THING YOU PLAY GRAND THEFT AUTO FOR! FUN IN VEHICLES! Hacking the game is the best way to go about this btw you only get banned for 2 weeks and keep all your stuff for some mentally challenged reason... Also the 5 10 million dollar things!? Buy a couple $100 shark cards and you can afford them oh btw they're just for looks you can get something that functions the same for a quarter of the price ).This one hit me personally. All the tediously hard missions I've never understood why game devs do this... I know half of these are completely optional but it's still money that you really want and need if you play legit like me... Like flight school... jesus christ I've never played something so hard in my life it's boring hard annoying and it over all made me angry and that's why I'm writing this poorly done review... because the game is me off. Trust me if you got some good friends there is fun to be made out of the grinding if you have some time just hack the game and you'll also have a ton of fun if you have money buy shark cards on top of the $60 game you can spend an extra $100 to have even more fun than the base game! Oh and by the way a shirt costs $14000. EDIT Started playing again with friends super fun but still the same bull shi applies but hackers seem to be a bigger problem I see at least 1 a day... and they're usually ready to ruin your experience for some reason..."
Product received for free. This game makes me suicidal. Teammate scored goal on overtime.
Bears that no clip through rocks and kill you. 10/10
Amazing so far. Great sequel to the series and finally on PC. Running on a GTX 760 at 1440p. 4k looks nice but FPS drops to below 30. Buttery smooth 1440p.Radio is very entertaining. The map has definitely changed alot since San Andreas but there are still some areas that are very close and reminicent of the older game. Cars handle alot better than GTA IV. Switching between characters isn't as bad as I thought it would be. I'm also a big fan of how the map is not locked down from the beginning such as all the other GTA games. First thing I did after the prologue was boost a car drive to the airport and grabbed the first plane I found and cruised around the map (dat turbulence). Love this game so far. Only played online for a few minutes and hit rank 3. Lots of potential and really looking forward to continuing this game. 10/10.
Best Game! I love it..
it is a realy fun game you should try it. takes up to 1 min to get in a game but it is worth it. at 14.99 it is worth it buy it
Great and fun game needs some balance changes and some killer buffs. Very fun 4v1 gameplay and interesting concept. Has a slight learning curve but not too much.Edit After playing for decent amount of time this game has a lot of bugs and i cant play with my friends cuz survive with friends is broken. Please fix this games stupid bugs.Edit 2 This game has too many bugs. Don't support these developers cuz they are very lazy.
I got banned for not doing anything illegal what bull is this account reset after like 3 months of playing and got up to like level 100 with different cars not even modding and just got banned.Negggativee
The only football game worth playing.
Pretty good time with friends. Fun to master.
nice
You already took our money now you take our modding ability? Screw you Take Two.
I think it's pretty telling when a very large portion of the players who have reviewed this game have over several hundred hours in the game. The game doesn't look like much but it's strangely addicting. Before you know it you've got almost 500 hours in the game.
Game is great but rockstar sucks.
Ditto.
in this game if you kill more than 10 players you will be banned.well done bluehole.
Endless fun especially with friends
it's alright
You just need a beastly/good pc to play. The players are better than what you will find on Fortnight and the game itself is more realistic. If you like battle royal games have a good pc and don t get mad easily with bugs then I recommend.
God developers 60 tickrate
Social Club UI crashing every time the launcher starts up no solution
Is this a Dark Souls pokemon game
They ruined mod support.
Gave me anal fissures.
Have had a lot of fun with Rust over the last several days of playing. The Devs seem to listen to the player base and make modifications to the game on a regular basis. If you like survial/crafting games this is a good bet.
THIS GAME SUCKS
cant even mine regular stone .
Click Play and nothing happen ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ! What's the problem!
Don't buy this disgusting game. Poor Servers. Lack of Anti Hacker. these game is full of hackers. These developers dont even know hoe to write code for the Basic UI. Thank God they didn't make Complex UI or elese The game Would Have Lagged there it self. the worst game in the world.
I enjoy it. Better with people you know of course (but which game isn't).. I'm not good at these types of games but hey that's never stopped me with other games
This game is so fun I love it I definitely reccomened it if you like a challenge if you dont mind waiting a bit to get into a game of course that is my only problem is playing with friends because its so difficult to get in a game with them besides kill your friends. But overal I give it a 9.5 out of 10 because I just love this game to death.
GOD GAME.
Ruined this games with greedy bs.
PUBG H1Z1
.
its ok
eSports Ready
IN! REALLY IN AWESOME!
I love to play this game with friends and it is very fun of a game!
improve ur server little .
Great game. Great excitement. Sorry my english I'm canadian.
nc game btw
THIS GAME IS AWESOOOOOOME!A LOT OF FUN A LOT OF CHEATERS A LOT OF UNFAIR GAMIIING!ONLY FOR 60$110/110HOW LONG I NEED TO PLAY TO BUY A ING GOLD PLANE?!
Sometimes it's more frustrating than fun some of the killers are entirely too OP but they're still putting out balance and bug fix patches so I guess it's OK.
The Best Game EVER!!!!!!!!
Product received for free. Good game i recommen it !!
Rockstar really ed themselves over as did take two. Banning online modding is one thing but going and banning single player modding is just stupid.
Naked men chasing other naked men with rocks.10/10decent game needs a little improvement
it will win the nominate mark my word v
Wow... is all i have to say
Product received for free. PUBG probably is the most exciting game that i've ever played on Steam! It's undeniable that it has a non stop increase in the number of players! Love it so much! U guys should get it before it gets higher price! _ _ _
great game. highly recommended
Dank
good game
"OVERALLOversold lie. Rust can be a fun game. It's a community game so most of the dynamics depend on playing with a good community that you agree with. If you want to run in a shoot on sight cut throat server you can find one. If you want to do ""PVE"" for whatever that is you can find a server catered to you. However Rust is definitely geared towards PVP and killing/raiding other people's bases and creating your own. I have some logged hours in which I had fun with friends. This was gifted to me for I personally feel like alpha games now have a bad stigma. THE BAD.Now let's go to the real The creators themselves have stated that they are still trying to find their 'vision' (at the time of this post). They probably have more under wraps that they do not want to reveal but all updates to this point have shown this to be true. Since they have no plan their updates are fairly useless and have not really affected gameplay. Polishing textures making stuff look better etc... The game has been virtually the same the past few months disappointingly. The more time goes on the more it feels like a scam. As an alpha game you expect the updates to be massive changes to the structure rather than focus on lower priorities. This is not to say they may not be working on important things but it has yet to be released.Everywhere there is discussion between the fan communities there is the same banter between constructive/deconstructive criticisms and zealous fans. ""Where's some real updates?!"" HAVE SOME PATIENCE YOU )#$*% IT TAKES TIME TO MAKE A GAME"" some feature is bugged and broken! fix it jerks!"" GIVE THEM A BREAK IT'S ALPHA CAN'T YOU READ ACEHOz GEEZ LA WEEZetc...Since it's alpha most of the loyal followers give them a free pass at everything as well as having infinite patience. The developers participation in dialogue with the community is fairly one way. There is a lack of transparency and warmth. In the end the developers' dearth of professionalism really shows. While it may not be a fair comparison the frequency and amount of updates in the patches in DayZ compared to Rust are quite surmountable. Rust could still be a great game but as of now I would be hesitant to give to these developers. This is 2014 lots of games are anticipated save your money for the big hitters."
The most immersive and comprehensive third person car soccer game ever created in the history of mankind.
The single player campaign was pretty good. I prefer creating my own character in these kind of games and didn't really care for the three main character thing. I don't blame them for trying though. There was a lot of love (and hard work) put into this game and it shows.Multiplayer is pointless. Unless you grind through missions for months you won't be able to buy 1/4 of the cool stuff available (cars planes property etc). I still mess around online with friends but it would be great if you could earn money without buying shark cards or paying a hacker.
I have motion sickness because I can't turn off motion blur and there's no FoV slider either. Is this a pc game?Lost all game data because of a bug that apparently was also always in Ps4 and never fixed... Wtf? time to play something else
Most of the bugs are now fixed but there there still seems to be hacking and cheating though it is significantly better than in previous months. Overall great concept with gameplay that matches.
Great game. 10/10 would buy many times again.
Got banned because I forgot to give a offline mod out of my gta file.
Fornite is quite the solid game but definitly more work and time.. 1/10 GigglesWait what? This isn't fornite?
Must play this game.
Roll the dice And run for your life.And hope you do not get surprise by blast to your face!If you survive to the end the big blue will take the rest of your life.For there is only dinner for one so prepare yourself to fall out of a airplane again!
Better. I ing thought so. Modding is back so I can agree with this game again.
I love it
This game unexpected make you breathless
It's just great as it does. Although sometimes there are many bugs and take a long time to get in to a match. Still this is the one of my recommended game to be played by horror genre lover .
Joined a group of naked people and went around shooting everyone in sight with crossbows. 10/10
20 Dollars for a ing rip off. Nice servers
This game had the most potential of any video game I had ever seen. The first day I got this I got completely lost in it and played for over 12 consecutive hours. Even the bugs in the game added a little bit of charm to the game.However the devs somehow managed to shoot themselves in the foot over and over and over again. They constantly add new features that nobody asked for while neglecting to fix game breaking bugs that have been in the game since day one. This game is an unoptimized ugly choppy broken mess that I could maybe justify playing if it was free.As is this game has no redeeming qualities and shows no signs of improving. Please do yourself a favor and save the money. Do not support these devs.
Best game for willys /10
kill people
BLA BLA BOGA BOGA
game of the year
recomennd to everyone!
Product received for free. Very fun game to play especially with friends. Would recommend to buy it if you enjoy battle royale games.
you kidding me? this game is the only battle royal game worth anything.
enjoy the game with u'r friends live u'r dream life in vr!
Amazing game has a bunch of pro's in it but the biggest con for many people is the DX11 other than that its an awesome game
Take Two has essentially banned SINGLE PLAYER modding for GTA V via OpenIV. Please do not support them or this behaviour by buying this game.
Best game na if you want to build see everything that you worked on demolished. Then they kill you and put your body in a chest
I've played almost every monster hunter game and this is probably the best it has ever been
Fast paced RC cars and cool fields to play football what a cool game!
Awesome
Rust is good at there jobs
I have been playing this game for more than 700 hours since the early access.There were periods that the game was really bad but I was keep playing and supporting it hoping that they will fix it one day.Now the game is unplayable to a point that after so many hours I cannot stand it.This company is a joke really they do not care simply... So goodbye from me glory hole sorry bluehole and if you read this just don't buy the game.
GET RID OF THE CHEATERS. Just download Fortnite it's free.
Sure let's the whole modding community I see nothing wrong with that
I find this game very fun. they still need to do more for the graphic options and i have had a few connection issues but this game isstill fun as heck.
great game highkly reccomend if you have a squad of 5 memebers or 4 great fun and is well designed
GREAT EXPERINECE
Good game for Killing and stealing. The game is even better with friends
I love this game and I wanted to grind it out quite hard after waiting more than two weeks for the release however I came to a huge dissapointment.After buying it straight when it came out I couldn't run the game at all and I still can't after some time of waiting for the optimisation patch or something like that. After going through pretty much every post on the forum and tutorials on youtube how to max out the performance of this unoptimised I give up. The minimum system requirements are a total lie and only the best rigs can run it fine... It's a shame but I will still wait for the patch because I really enjoy watching the game and I would be even more pleased if I could actually play it. For 27 I expected much better. As I said there is nothing wrong with the game itself it's just the performance and optimisation section which made me not recommend this game at the current time. After some months I will revisit this game and do another review of this to see if anything changes.UPDATE After the optimisation update and buying new RAM I have little to no problem of running the game.
Poorly optimized.
Closest thing to a sport I'm going to be playing.
lot of good memories
Take two interactive now seem to have a stricks anti modding policy with effectively banning OpenIV (the backbone to a large amount of GTA V mods) they aim to push people away from single player and into multiplayer in an effort to make them spend more money on micro transactions. Looks like having the 4th best selling game of ALL TIME and making billions of dollars already wasn't enough for Rockstar and Take Two. GTA IV didnt have this problem as Rockstar was not as money hungry and didn't have micro transactions in their game. What a disgrace.
I would highly recommend you get this game because of the depth it has. But they have a very very very big problem modders. These trash talking scumbags of the game are in every session you join so you either have to be in a solo lobby (which limits what you can do) or just not play online at all which is stupid. You would think they would but some vac on or something but no nothing. They have no anticheat so if there is a modder in your game they only get banned after they log off the game. Remember what i said about getting the game well yeah don't until they put anticheat into the game because you only get half of what you purchased basically. The worst i got was a ddos attack and i was out of internet for half an hour. Just is not worth it
Worst game I ve ever played. Zero optimization
Best GAME EVER! #10/10WouldRecommend
PUBG got me playing games again. Love this game!
Rockstar has pulled the wool over our eyes. We were expecting a moding experiance that would add years to this game. However 1 month after millions of players purchased this game and no longer had any chance of gaining a refund for there money they decided to alter their EULA. Now the End User Licences Agreement forbids a user from altering the game in any capicity. Meaning if you Mod this game you will be banned from not only the multiplayer servers but from your own private singleplayer games aswell.I can not reccommend this game I was had.
skins&gt bugs
decent game but very very unoptimized.
lol
This game is lit af
Do I really need to recommend that? D
This game is the (good kind of . lol at all the people that been complaining they cant run it. Their specs are mad weak lmao
Rust? More like trash!Gave me high blood pressure and got a heart attack 10/10 would recommend to someone I hate
Gr8 m8 I r8 8/8
Just get bored with online gamingplaying mod in singleplayerone day try to play with friend realized i got banned.thank you rockstar.
Product received for free. This game is amazing escpaily with friends if you want to laugh so hard then play rumble with your friends so fun tho really love this game !!
BestGame
please reconnect
Took two thing I hate cars and football and made them good any game that can do such a thing is needless so say great.
THis is the stupiest FN game out there. YOu have to be logged on 24/7 and never log off else you get r ape d while your gone. Yes your body stays in place the WHOLE time your logged off! I will never recommend this game to anyone as its obvious the dev's are stupid!
Cool and good!
I like this game but my PC cry everytime when I open GTA V10/10 would smash my PC again
"Once this game is no longer in pre release my opinion will probably change. But right now there are so many glitches and hackers/cheaters that it's not worth playing. Hopefully it changes with the new updates coming out.Edit I still hate it but at least the hackers aren't quite as bad. But anyways a game should not need a giant PR ""hey we're finally fixing our game (fix pubg)"" campaign to let everyone know that they're finally gonna fix their broken game. You should just fix your product as you go once you become aware of game breaking physics since that's generally what's expected of you as the owner and developer. The fact that they need this giant ""fix pubg"" campaign like its a good thing should tell you how bad this game is. If I could go back and do it all over I would've invested all my time in Fortnite and never even touched this game. 0/10 would not play again and absolutely hate myself for the sheer amount of time I've sunk into this broken game.Thank you for your time and have a nice day."
A triple AAA title that's actually good a welcome surprise.
Ehh it's alright.The game is a bit 'competitive' tho.Just only bit.Also best game to learn mandarin
&gt Spawn in at 1 in the morning&gt Loads of nodes wood and hemp everywhere&gt Harvest a tonne of each resource&gt Break barrell and learn revolver blueprint&gt Find large furnace start to refine&gt tab out for one sec&gt tab in and die to helicopterthis game is cute and i love it
Great game but online is Can barely even get onto it got onto it once and after that no matter how long I wait or what I do it doesn't load. Plus the time I did manage to get online an kept spawn killinig me basically forcing me to quit. So if you're going to get this game only get the story mode
Gameplay is fantastic. I couldn't ask for much better for a challenging RPG experience like this. 10/10. Servers are a whole different issue however and I hope Capcom improves it soon.
The Game is full of cheaters like me
"GET this game! Even if you think you won't really like it once you start playing you won't be able to stop its an addictive game and the good part is there is no ""higher level"" gear which gives anyone a leg up so it stays really competitive.10/10 !"
that's a very nice game i like it so much
Product received for free. Good Game
The beeest game eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeevvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeer
this game sucks its so laggy u can barly move
Not a bad game but the rampant microtransaction nickle and dime hell plus the absolute hostility against mods makes this a never buy. Give your money to someone more deserving.
RIP OpenIV.
Product received for free. WTF COPIED FORTNITE GAY
I love the story/singleplayer mode a lot more than the online multiplayer. The story mode gives purpose for gamers who like objective type of games. Also it creates different missions help the gamer experience almost everything the game has to offer such as the Stranger Things missions (like side missions you talk to certain strangers to get them). Additionally the story mode has 3 sets of characters with difference personalities which are Michael Franklin and Trevor (I love him the most cause he be wildin). On the other hand I'm not a real fan of grinding but online multiplayer is alright at first (because of the customizable character and beating random people) but it's highly recommended that you play with a friend because things can get lonely when you're soloing the missions or VIP/CEO works to earn money. Overall this game is all about the grinding to get more money to buy whatever when you're in online multiplayer mode and story mode lasts about 40 hrs? but it's imo worth it.
These negative reviews make me sad. I just cracked out on this game for four solid days and it was fantastic.After 67 hours of lovely grinding I can positively say that this port is acceptable networking issues aside.I strongly believe that if your hardware is up to snuff and you ensure the latest drivers are in place you too could have a wonderful stable game that plays like butter.No crashes.Solid 60 frames. (Barring Daora's ultimate move affectionately dubbed 'The FPS Shredder')Controls are great if you use a controller. If you don't consider getting one. This isn't a FPS. Why would you play a 3rd person hack'n'slash with a keyboard?I've never played a MH title before and I absolutely love this game. 5 stars.

"This game is fun and frustrating at the same time. The concept is great but the execution so far has been sub par. I've played for 200+ hours and have not really had the crashing issues many have experienced. My biggest complaints are my FPS has dropped 10 15 FPS on average the lack of region control and hackers. I could live with the FPS drop if I could at least play with someone who speaks my language. It seems likely that they might have also been banned a time or two with names like ""56894565"". The whole point of servers in dedicated regions is to be able to communicate with your squad mates. I hope in time some of these issues will be addressed. My system has plenty of horsepower so that isn't an issue."
I have re installed 5 times and triedv various online suggestions the game fails to launch. Terrible experience so far.
Paul Chuckle approves!
"I'd just like to start off by saying the game is great. The amount of hours I have put into it is only rivaled by the likes of CSGO. The gameplay is fast and action packed. If you are able to get some friends to buy this game with you. Do it.Now comes my problem. I got home today excited to jump back into the action only to be greeted by ""You have been permanently banned in PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS by the game's developer"" I didn't quite know how to react so I looked to see if it was a possible mistake or maybe some negligence on my behalf. So I went through all my game files and other programs on my computer. After coming up empty I decided to look at my name and my profile to see if I had any offensive or derogatory content that might offend some people. Besides the vulgar comments left by my friends I could not find anything that could contribute to a permaban. So I submitted a ticket and decided to write this review. I will be more than happy to change the review to positive if this problem can be ironed out. I am even willing to change the review and remain positive as long as Bluehole and/or PlayerUnkown can give me a valid explanation for the permabanning with evidence. Until this however I am going to leave this review up. I wholeheartedly want this game to succeed over competitors like fortnite. But if this is how longtime players players who have actively supported the game since its alpha stages are being treated. Then I cannot find it within me to give this game a positive review."
Love this game but..........The real issue is the mixed servers. i pick any area in the world you end up with a ton of chinese people yelling a load of jibberish down the mic. Just hope your team mates arent chinese as they will prob kill you if you dont kill them first. There has to be more segregation between mixed lauguanges. you should have to pick this before selecting servers. Make for a much more enjoyable experience.
gud

Good but please fix the lag!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Open Iv is back es
Ruined an excellent game. Sad.
Runs really well on low grade PCs and still looks amazing 3
Good game Get shot in the back everytimeBuild base not longer than 1 minute later get raided and taken in as a slave
The best game for kicking back and having giggle with your mates in a rocket powered game of car footy.
If you like v bucks then you will kill yourself. Pubg is gay and it is also straight that is why I masturbate to traps.
Almost didn't buy this game due to only having 1 mode and 1 map. But surprisingly it's really fun. I do hope that bring in a mode like H1Z1 Just Survive.

It's ok I guess.

One of the greatest games I've ever played. When this first came out years ago there was nothing like it except Arma 2 Dayz. I immediately loved it and have played it off and on for years.
Bluehole made the best game on earth but then came the crashes and the server that stop working!!!!!!!!!Bluehole PLZ FIX.

bad game
1 of my favorite and fun games i have ever got.it is worth 20$
Probably the worst Battle Royale game ive ever ing played. This game is Filled with Hackers and Cheaters and it appears the devolopers are trying to add more Maps and more t into the game Rather than Fix all the Problems it has. The game Runs SOOOO SLow and Choppy compared to other games. I have gave this game so many chance to get Good but they rather make a buck than make a decent game this is a Pile of !
já pensei em dar refund dai meus amigos ficaram dizendo que não era para eu fazer isso pq a gente jogava juntodai quase todo mundo parou de jogar e eu mandei o fodase e fiquei jogandoo que se tu cair com um assasino de outro pais tu já perde

This game is one of the best games for playing with friendsYou can build your own house or everything you want to you can travel in the big map you can find weapons and clothes or craft itI recommend to play this game with friends
Just to support people being banned for modding.... Actually not.Single part is short. Primitive plot lack of story moves lack of characters and situations. Online part is pretty boring unbalanced unorganized. In two years they still couldn't make it full of things to do.The game that costed 120+ millions $ (as I've heard) looks totaly unfinished.It's really awfull. It takes 70 hours to pass single part yes. But it still feels small and toneless. I never liked GTA SA and GTA4 but they are totaly better in a story part. Yes 5th part full of optional things to do. But you won't do them all. Skyfalls and all that internet stuff and etc. will become boring after 3 times Cinemas too. What else? Side missions are good. But they are few 2 3 additional gang members for robberies (you will need them for one affair lol) and some funny stories about 3 4 NPCs with overall timeage 1 2 hours. It's ridiculous.
Amazing game. Keeps things new with constant updates
Ran for 30min just to be gunned down by a guy in a bush 10/10 would be killed again.
I think I've played enough of this game to write a review.This is a really great game and is worth buying. I recommend playing on a controller.It's really fun and it can be casual but even from gold and higher it gets really competitive and hard. There are a lot of mechanics that you can learn and there's always something new to do. The key and crate system is ok and you can get free keys (you can't trade with the items tou get from crates opened with then decryptors) for playing the game.
totally worth the wait this game is amazing but still some bugs here and there but it's real fun. AND GLORIOUS 60 FPS
They should have seperated GTAV and GTAOnlineEven NON modders and Legit players are being banned and having their characters reset.STOP Buying Shark Cards and perhaps they will get off their asses and make GTA 6
yes
Best game to release in awhile!
How do I refund my money spent on this game?
Drive Demolition Score Repeat 10/10
I was really excited about this game for a long time and had high hopes for it. But then the problems started coming in and rather than working to fix them and take into consideration what the community has been saying seriously the developers would much rather make easy money marketing off of popular horror/slasher movie characters and add more stuff that work on existing problems. The problems early on were the lag among other glitches in terms of movment and actions that made things difficult as a survivor. However the most pervasive problem that has not improved in the slightest is the camping from players as the Killer. Non stop time and again there have been Killers who manipulate the game and take away the enjoyment from playing. They have the advantage and are choosing not to play fair and the people who update this game and see this problem consistently have chosen to side with the camping Killers and it appears as though they have gone out of their way to aid them in their slaughter. Maybe instead of adding Killers like Freddy who put everyone to sleep with no means to wake themselves up consider trying to tackle the really issues with the playablity of the game without adding on more issues. Try making it so that if the Killer is within a certian radious of a Survivor that is on the hook for longer than 15 seconds they are immediatley teleported to a different location on the map that is 75 meters away from anybody so as to not put other Survivors at a disadvantage and prevent the manipulation of the game via camping. Because when a Killer camps they do not earn their rank they steal it. If this continues people will see the game as worthless in terms of playing as a Survivor and play as the Killer. But once eveyone plays and camps as the Killer who will they play against? No one. There is nothing wrong with adding new content and creating new fun and unique experiences for players but it should not be the only thing the people updating the game are willing to do. This game needs alot more work and time needs to be spent fixing these issues not brainstorming new ways to pump money out of players via a broken game by adding one shiny new thing.Also on your stream don't say for people to play another game. Beacuse when you show that level of insulting indifference to concerned community members that is just what they'll do play a different game. So be careful what you wish for because it's starting to become true.
Fun Quick Games... Hours of entertainment.
such a great game
I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. For a game in Early Access it's pretty fun to play with your buddies. It has some issues sure but that's expected. I recommend it to all.
getting worse and worse over time server problems and ingame bugs dont seem to disappear after updates but increase. only contentupdates. infested with cheaters and afk creditfarmers
nice game

"Update Now gam wont run. load of Update Still so brokenCouldnt walk down stairs clipping due to slow server posdition update. Game is a joke. Can't get out off vehicle then when you do end up with flying animation! You end up with a couple of good games then death from ""out of play area"" because your stuck in scenery! orig buggiest game I've played in a long time. sort your servers out. not seriously playable right now. fun when you get a less laggy game but seems to be getting worse not better"
Very nice be sure to get a controller for the best experience thou. Only bad thing about it is 1 Modders.2 Rockstar being greedy s and bringing out updates which cost MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS. So be sure to have friends to play with to get maximum fun and maybe a private lobby.
Product received for free. SHitiest game I ever seen
this game sucks
need more people on moded servers but the game is awesome shooting people but i think they need to add more building s and funs like the SKS and even a Uzi or something cool how bout a RPG then ill be in the taliban
Product received for free. Completely survivor sided looping toxic nonsense of a crap game.
this game is amazing you can have played this game for like 400 hours and you still wont know what will happen.
Football 4/10 11/10 with rocket cars
Totally regret buying this game. Ive given it plenty of chances and it has its moments where its fun with friends but those moments are very few. If you like spending time collecting items and then instantly dying from someone sitting in a corner of a bathroom then this games for you. If you like shooting 30 rounds at one person before they die (if your hits even register) then this game might be for you. If you actually think this is a good game you probably ate glue in elementary school and jerk it to hentai.
This game no allowing mods is a disgrace. Don't buy this.
Solid game well worth the $$$
fun while it lasted going downhill since launch
710/710 would get pulverized by a pink T rex again.
I havent got to play rust at all because the lag is so insane! I have it on fastest graphics and my resolution is low but it still lags! Hope they fix the lag.
Rocket League is easy enough to make you want to come back for more and competitive enough to make you sweat and cry for your wins. Easily the game I always need just one.more.match.

It's a good game but Take Two Interactive has just effectively shut down the modding scene for this game by cease and desisting OpenIV which has been in development for 10 years and has been endorsed by Rockstar themselves. Until that changes I can not and will not recomend this game.Edit Take Two Interactive has reconsidered its decision and retracted the Cease and Desist and Rockstar is talking with OpenIV to help stop the issues the way it should have been done in the first place.
This game is the best game ever... there are so many things to do in this game and its amazing but if you are doing solo don't buy it...
It's good.
As much as I love GTA V and Rockstar Games Take Two really screwed this one up. I understand that if the mods are voilating any online rules or legal stuff you should be able to take those ones down but SINGLE PLAYER MODS AS WELL? Single player mods are doing absolutely no harm whatsoever to your game I think that these modders are making GTA V a much better game because the truth is I don't really enjoy story mode so much so single player is just boring without mods. The world you created in Los Santos is so detailed and so well made that I think it should be explored more but without mods it just gets really damn boring. I'm sorry but that's the truth. Bring mods back. That's all I have to say.
Product received for free. Best buy and good game i don't have any frame drops and im sorry for people who have
ing piece of game running on 9 ticks 8 months straight never fixed
Game is a lot of fun.. Until you realize 90% of users are using AimBots among a lot of other hacks that let them know where you are.. Once they find a way to ban those users it might be interesting.
After changing my review and waiting for GTA to load I like GTA 5.I usually play online but the game is still okay. Enough said Probably around 8/10 or 7. Too much of a grind and all.
This game is dead. They try to squeeze your money out of your pocket.
Product received for free. I don't know if anyone noticed but I have noticed an increase of modders per lobby now. They weren't as plentiful a month ago. But now they're getting to be a more common sight now.
Addicting Fun competitive tense hilarious and overall worth every penny including its DLC! If you want a game to just jump into and get playing and love online competitions? THIS IS FOR YOU! YOU BUY NOW! K? JUST DO IT!! 10/10
OK This games great however be prepared to spend 26 hours trying to get a specific item because sometimes it happens. Also the hitboxes are a little janked up. The story's also pretty mediocre. BUT BUT BUT the game is still fun the combats fun and when has a monster hunter game ever had a good story? its just fun Idk what to say.
Just got the game its pretty good )
better than destiny
rip wooden pc
fggt gem fer fggts
It has too many bugs so just go and play fortnite for free you can also have more fun from this crap.Does not worth the price tag. You can actually have more fun on mobile version for free.finally do not buy it .
First of all I do like the game. So why the thumbs down Its overpriced for for a mod/cheat infested multiplayer. You can only play multiplayer on a decent way with some friends in a private session. I had hoped the update would change it but it didn't. And after some time leaving this game i came back to see the new update. Now I can't connect anymore to the socialclub (getting error 202) and play the multiplayer. After filing a ticket to support they told me to change my DNS server in order to play this game. First time this ever happend ill give them that. It does work playing on a VPN or changing DNS but I really do not want to do this for a game. Its a game it should work like all other games!
A guy stole my stone and torch. Im still salty!
Fantastic game. Fun to play with friends.9/10Servers are hit and miss but only like 1/8th of the time
CAN'T CRAFT FAL. 0/10 Ian Smith is not impressed.
bagus sih
A more adult friendly yet incomplete Minecraft.Has lots of potential but PVE aspects (ex NPCs) decorations and other tweaks need to be made to make the worlds it creates more alive. I would like to see a settlement system akin to the rudimentary one in Fallout 4 albeit expanded upon. The game also needs tweaks to prevent toxic griefing behavior and promote more cooperation instead.Still a ways to go since it's in Alpha but it has the potential to be a great game upon release.
UPDATE Now game is dead custom matches has become a thing so i create one to try it out game moderators instantly delete it cause i'm not a streamer.What a joke.Not worth $5 now if you get it for free maybe. UPDATE It's terrable again. UPDATE It got better again. So they make the game hacker friendly by using a trash anti cheat tons of other problems i won't mention but one early this they fixed well was when you downed a person and took the majority of their health you got the kill. EVERYBODY was happy with this now they decide to restore the bad system with added bugs where whoever does the last shot whether or not they did much damage they get the kill remind me why i play this game?
crap
10/10 would rate. if you like hackers and trollers then this game is for you. HAARO

Too many bugs poor servers with high ms.
Pay us money!
"Probably the worlds best/worst game ever. Honestly if you're a 12 year old haHAA then you are fine to go online and be a and do anything you want because cops are a joke. If you want realism this is not it period. If you want to play this game solo this game is not for you. If you even want to go on and try to make friends and do stuff with people.... this game is not for you. If you already have a group of friends and want to play the game do stuff together well it might be for you as long as you don't join a full up server.Everything that you do out in the open is flagged for everyone to see which is what makes this game a giant dog turd online. If it was a bit more realistic and you actually had to find the things that were going on ""behind the scenes"" like they should be it would be way better. Hey want to go online and do some drug shipments or maybe deliver some other goods from our warehouses... welp ya can't why? Because everyone on that server sees what you are doing and everyone will gun for you. Every step of the way you are tracked.... hell even just walking around you are flagged... on the map. Who the f*** is this game for other than complete a$$***** no one.The single player is a lot of fun well put together and you can run around in this giant world trying to build an empire... but... you can only do so much. They force you into multiplayer in order to do new content like the biker gangs warehouses and such. I really feel as if they robbed me from content I figured would all be a part of the game. I don't understand how they feel it is all right to publish all of this content and never mention that... by the way... its only in multiplayer. And what I don't get is why? The game has already been killed off by hackers all of the records have been claimed by them billions of dollars have been given away.... but you have to do this stuff online with other people... why?? Why can't me and a few friends get together in private and do them together? and allow everyone to do that? I just don't get it and if you think you have a point to make I haven't thought of you're fooling yourself. I get for races and deathmatch and all that stuff needs to happen online vs other people duhr but all of this new stuff should be allowed in private. You still send that information to them when you do them there is no difference. And why is everything flagged from where people are to shipments running around the map to planes boats people are driving. It makes absolutely no sense and ruins the immersion for me. Single player probably 9/10 multiplayer 1/10 only because it has it.Remember this is my personal opinion I am not looking for fanboys to come flame I've loved gta since the very first this one just misses the mark because they add all of this stuff and it is just something I'll never be able to see. Rockstar F'd the franchise for me with these last updates and the openworld system that just doesn't work."
so this is the only game that has uncensored
i like the trade available and the comunity the community is like a family except the scamers (you should ban scammers i love you rocket league
its K
The best!!!
Good
game still broken y add Event Pass plss fix game first
The game is still in the early stages of its' development. Far from completion Rust is a PvP masterpiece which successfully replicates some aspects of dystopian survival. The game is only 20$ and will eventually evolve into a critically aclaimed gem. My advice purchase the game now while the price remains low. Buy now before the cost doubles or even triples..
This game was a ton of fun at the beginning but the more you played of it the more repetative it got. Eventually I got bored of doing the same thing over and over again so I stopped playing.
i liked the beaches they were nice and warm and i could skuttle around with all my friends. plenty of flappy dong meat to pinch. skuttle crab paradise.
Even though this game is in early access it is amazing. One of my favorite games as of now.In the beginning it is kinda confusing due to the lack of instructions but as you play on you will get the hang of it.Essentially the game is minecraft in space with an amazing art style

Been playing since the first monster hunter in PSX and I love it. mostly I played with my brother and this game is preferably played with friends.
smh.
massivily successful and still servers. Other BR games are 1000% more smooth and just as fun if not more. I cant see myself ever jumping back on PUBG anymore after this
Good game but like people say more fun with friends and even make some friends along the way

I'm not even a fotball fan or sport fan but there is something about this game which makes it great! Highly encourage people to get it and play it because it's a great party game!
Really enjoyable game amazing concept if the game acutally worked. you know its been a whole goddamn year and i still cant invite friends it still has huge bug issues. you can never connect to servers it is with out a doubt the most dishonest broken game ive come across! but if you do manage to actually have the luck of being on when the servers arent broken no hackers bugs and general t that shouldnt be in a game a year on then year its a fun and good game. but if i was to lose this game and have to buy it again or known how broken it was before i would have never purchased it
very fun. i like smashing monster heads with oversized weapons
Lots of fun!
Good if you have friends to play with otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it. Though it has been a while since I played with friends so things probably have changed.
Buy it if you want to play solo online is complete crap right now.
10/10 ANDREWTHEBOSS
Great Game so far works great and fun as it should be not much to say other then that.
It's a game based on your server community. I can see it being fun on a private server with friends or two defined factions. Small idiot kids killing new spawns for 200 wood is just . On most servers people assume you are not friendly so will kill on spot. Shows how ed up the world would be without reprecisions.
"In my opinion one of the best games I've played over the past few months and if you like the idea of RC Cars combined with footbal/soccer it is definitely worth the 20 bucks.Rocket League has a great learning curve combined with a simple ""easy to play hard to master"" playstyle.Personally there are just a few downsides being a laptop player there are some maps which give me a FPS drop (for example Aquadome in which i play with 40 45 FPS rather than the usual 60) but with a decent PC you won't have that problem. The second downside apllies mostly to casual games where you find all those salty players who leave at the very instant when the other team scores a 1 2 or a 0 1.Overall it is a brilliant game with great gameplay mechanics and a mostly very nice community."
wtf is this bugg when you cant walk and shoot
this is a great game i love it play with my mates on it every day i reccomend it for any person
Edited The mod banning thing was a bummer... We used to meet up with all of my friends on the same session but there are some problems about that most of my friends have quitted the game because of that.. So many things need to be fixed before I could recommend this game.
A great game but be prepared to buy an SSD or wait the 8 minute loading time every time you want to join a server.
deym what can i say? so goood
Really fun and cool game it makes this really worth the price for manny years now it fun with other player in the game ! Recommend the 30$
Best Game Ever 2018

Great game and great community! Played it on and off since the early days and am looking forward to more improvements to be implimented into the game.
Buy Grand Theft Auto V Premium Online Edition &amp Great White Shark Card BundleIncludes 3 items Grand Theft Auto V Grand Theft Auto V Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack GTA V Great White Shark Card (Starter Pack Bundle)
game is broken
Ok sooo... Modding is illegal?Not recommended Rockstar. Nope.
it looks and runs like I have a gtx1080 ti and a i7 7700k and in certain areas it goes down to 40 fps. also new content is released way to slow. all we get is 1 new gun every quarter
I have installed this then uninstalled this and back again many times. I can't shake it. This game has me in its get up and go hooks.Better if you silence the music and play your own though. With it I got a more natural home grown attachment.
Best thing about this game is to get facecamped &lt 3
Got gang banged by a clan of rock holders 10/10Serious review Its a good game just mind that offical servers are a hellish nightmare so if you buy the game join modded servers. Their filled with anti cheats and admins D
Although i don't play it much still is an amazing game
One word Amazing
Hackers So many of them. They're indifferent one hacker will give you 30 million of in game cash the other ones will spawn things on your head and make your FPS drop from a stable 60 to 10. And the others outright kill you.Game is good. Multiplayer is okay.8/10 IGN
aight
Completely broken game. Now 1.0 is out and each round is literally unplayable the first few minutes because of horrible lags (comes down to rubberbanding). Whoever wrote the netcode You suck at this! This game is a mess even now it is out of early access. The hype is strong sure but the lack of quality is offensive.
nU tAk sebe !!

Online is amazing fun new content often better with friends!
so theres this guy whos naked all of the sudden he has pants on and my axe. he then takes axe cuts wood gets wood runs around for hours looking for stone finds stone kills animals with bows and my axe makes shelter makes bed makes campfire eats a uncook chicken throws up cooks the rest of the chicken and thne he full helath and good food. night comes theres not a sound man scared turns on campfire but is scared people with see him with bombs wait the night out repeat steps dies to a mean man that shoots him with a shotgun repeats steps dies by falling down from rock repeats step dies from an airplane crash repeats steps.. u know what i mean good game i recommended to all who play minecraft survival and feedthechicken and instacraftmodewtfamievenwritingnowidontknow and hungerplay or hungergames or wtf its called good game 10/10 would play again.
Fix PUBG and broke PUBG.PUBG BLUE SCREENED MY PC. YES MY PC CAN HANDLE IT IVE PLAYED WITH GAME FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. FIRST YEAR WAS GREAT BUT NOW ITS WORSE THAN HITLER.
This is one of the best games I have ever played! It's very realistic and quite thrilling so you'll pretty much never get bored while playing this. Also since this is an early access game it has tons of potents to become an ever better game!
The game is a master piece. The only downside is the people thair ruin your good time to have a good time of their own online but thats... anywhere.So yes Get this. Play the Campaign. Enjoy the beutiful map they created and wildlife in SinglePlayer. Then Hop on Multiplayer in the same Open world ( the animals )Just don't get this game if you don't like vulgarity is all. Otherwise if you can pick it up and experience it. And hey if it isn't your thing I appologise lol. I hope you get to enjoy a game as much as I enjoy this one one day
Absolutely great game! high skill cieling and keeps you coming back for more
GTA Online is awesome.
I love this game it's a load of fun with friends or without. Except the matchmaking is garbage. I recently spent 10 minutes searching for a game just for the killer to leave the lobby this happened again with the next lobby. If the matchmaking was more bearable this game would be brilliant unfortunatly as of now its rather disapointing.Edit The game has vastly improved since I first wrote this review but unfortunatly it is still not quiet worth it the issue is no longer the game itself for the most part with only same bugs and issues remaining as far as I can see the problem I find is the community who takes every chance to abuse whatever bugs glitchs or tricks they can in order to win often at the expense of the integrity of the match being played.I do enjoy this game tremendously when i manage to find a lobby with players that are fair and skilled but these lobbys are only just about half of the lobbies you can find. Its up to the community to fix this issue not the devs I can only hope the game can make it past this current Meta of abusing the game features to win.
Story mode funOnline mode farming simulator with great chances of dying and loosing everything. game
"""lucky shot"" ( ʖ )"
Very intriguing and fun to play. It's quite casual though you do need to memorize certain dates just in case you forget to switch your crops to another season's crops. Plan ahead just a bit and you'll have fun play this game.
Wait 10 minutes to get into a lobby. Get kicked out. Wait another 10 minutes to get into lobby and another 5 for match to launch. Get killed withing the first 2 minutes. No one comes to help. Rinse and Repeat. Quit uninstall thanks for the effort!
I still have not made it off the beach alive.
this game is amazing &lt 3
FIX your LOADING SCREENS
THIS GAME IS TRASH. MECHANICS ARE DOG MEAT.
A fantastic game with a fair few tarnishes that sometimes make it hard to feel excited for. Fairly poor optimisation really unintuitive online handling loads upon loads of menus. But when everything works and you're in the middle of the hunt the game is absolute gold.
trash
10/10would spend ??? dollars on more contentJust make it happen Capcom
Has performance issues a bit on pc until downloading a separate idox file to speed it up also really could use a multiplatform update.
fun boy
FIX THE FRAME RATE!!!FIX RUBBERBANDING!!!And you'll have a great game
Fun with friends
keep the work and fix the dayomm servers
Game is boring and nonengaging 24/7 This game just needs to die.
Not Bad....
挂那么多 自己封封吧 sb
Ridiculously inconvenient to party up and play with friends. Terrible control scheme with few options to customize it. Steam Notifications that block your item menu and wont go away until you force close the game. Absolute dumpster fire.
why wont it finish the update?its stuck on 83%
I LOVE RUST! I love everything about it I realize that there is so much that goes into developing a game and that there is so much to look forward to in rust. Keep up the great work becuase I will DIE if rust ever goes away! Thanks for your hard work!
Great fun game but needs to be tweaked for smaller end pc's
It's a great game! D
No thanks. Not my type of game.
I'm going to try and make this short ish.**I played around 400 hours of the game when I wrote this Singleplayer Amazing story and missions that I replay even to this day.Special abilities are awesome and gameplay is just amazing.If you have no internet this game is for you!10/10Online Well I notice most of the reviews are from people who got banned.From playing online mode for so long and being around level 120 right now I honestly have the fear of being banned for no reason. This should notbe a fear that I have if I do not mod/hack the game. I read other reviews and notice that they are exactly in my place right now 100ish level and a couple million dollars in the game. Why is it that I have the fear of gettingbanned for no reason while all the other hackers can easily roam freely without a carein the world? I think that there should be special servers for modding withoutupsetting those who want to play the game legit. Overall Online mode is fun butthere is a fear of getting banned for playing the game the way the creatorswant you to. I will keep playing this game but it is not right that R* is doingnothing about this problem.6/10
good game but it's very demanding on resources. be sure to have an high end rig to rule this at 60fps lock.
To be honest... Wait till an actual release. Game is beyond broken. Not worth the money to alpha test. Might be a good game someday but as it sits.. It's highly frustrating to play.
Take Two executives are legit money grubbing holes
Love it.

Long time MH fan started with Tri and then ended up playing every English version other than the OG Playstation one and also dabbled in MHO. I have to start by saying that the quality of life aspects alone make this game AMAZING to play. Things are so much simpler to do now. Wanna gather that plant? Good just grab it while you are walking past it DONE. The removal of paintballs is also rather welcome IMO. Many of these reviews that are negative will point out the connection issues I will say that as far as I can tell since the recent patch these issues are FIXED. Game runs great even on rigs and the fact that you can have monster hunter and freedom of control is just amazing. Keyboard and mouse controls are great once you change them from the wack defaults.If you are a long time MH fan then GET IT hands down. If this is your first MH game then GET IT. Long time fans will appreciate quality of life things that have been done newbs will appreciate just how ing awesome the game is. My only note is that THIS IS A GRINDY GAME. If that is not your thing maybe don't get it unless you just wanna play through the story and be done cause realistically the story is 10% of the real game which is all the end game grind be it for decos or gearsets or w/e you like.
"By far the worst investment I've ever made in a game in the past 10 years.So many bad things about this game I don't know where to begin.First of all the keyboard and mouse control are terrible and have all these annoying little things... like ""esc"" button won't take u to the previous menu and more things that u would think are like a basic thing in every game yet it's different in this one.Also graphics look terrible... for sure u can see the game was originally made for the console and the resolution looks like 720p even on a 1080p resolution or even 4k.Another annoying this which was the real deal breaker for me game saves only before and after missions!It doesn't save things instantly like a regular onlineg ame. So here's what happend to me I sat down going all out upgrading my equipment. Was so happy with all my new crafter stuff I went on an online quest (which for some reason didn't saved anything before I started it).... I landed... started collecting lots of cool stuff (again I was happy)...... and then all of a sudden a disconnection!Came back and guess what? NOTHING was saved. All my items all the things I've collected were nowhere to be found.THIS GAME IS BAD and might be worth 5$ TOPS!! (And I'm being genrous)."
10/10 Would own goal again
I waited an hour for a server to load and my game crashed i punched a hole in my ing mum.

very good very handsome
Nice Graphics worth the price!
A game with quite a lot of bugs and annoying people. And I'm addicted to it.
Definitely the most polish battle royale out...
"I waited over a half hour in queue to play this game. I come to the opening screen. It says ""you're sleeping press any key to wake up."" I press any key. I press all keys. I click my mouse. *click click click* Nothing. I have wireless keyboard and mouse. Maybe they've become unresponsive. Press windows key. Windows menu pops up. Press esc and suddenly I'm going through menus and then I'm back in the queue. Not waiting another 30 minutes."
small horse. game suck. crown hunt. suck. my life. my soul. drained.
Whitout friend its imposible you need at least 1 friend to star.There are problems but they really try solve the issues if there is.I think it will be beta soon.
with my limited time with this game I have come to the conclusion that this game can be mind bogglingly amazing and no fun at all sometimes you get a base setup and sometimes somebody kills you and takes all of your stuff sometimes you get raided and sometimes you do the raiding. The game in my expiriance has been very situational mabey you build your base hidden behind some rocks and then all of a sudden somebody with loads of gear builds on the other side of the rock formation without seeing your base and then when he sees it he decides it would be a good idea to burn down your poor little shack and take your 1 singular hatchet that you spent an hour trying to get because you kept on getting killed I will now recount one of my expiriances in this game me you know I think i'll build behind this pile of rocks in order to keep my base hiddennon descript guy with no clothes you know I think i'll build my house in the woods near that rock formationtwo annoying 14 year olds lets build our base right in between the woods and that rock formation!guy with a crossbow hey I see like 4 people over there building let me go murder them!me oh sh*t that guy with a crossbows running right at me!two annoying 14 year olds hey see that guy lets go scream curses and sh*t at him!non descript guy with no clothes god f*cking dammit more people here to kill meme SH*T SH*T SH*T! F*CK F*CK F*CK!1 minute later...me OH GOD WHY I WAS JUST TRYING TO BUILD IN THIS CONVENIENTLY EMPTY SPOT!guy with a crossbow get rekt m8
I loved GTA V. Loved past tense. Seriously not cool for killing the modding community don't tell me how to game.
"Fun game can't wait for more content to be released!Some people say it's buggy and glitchy personally I haven't experienced too much of that. The ""Arid"" planet sometimes go ape and divides itself into 4 slices of pizzaplanet. But as soon as you get on it it shapes up again.To be honest you kinda need a sense of wonder if you are going to enjoy this game.I've spent 17 hours now and Im pretty much done with all the content. I can keep exploring if I want but there is no need for it really.If you are bored as hell like me and looking for a good solid 20 hours entertainment then this is the game.And since more content are probably going to be released in the near future I can highly recommend it. There are materials in the game that have no current use at this moment. But I love the crafting system and the art style so yeah thumbs up."
if your a fan of rust youtubers its extremely easy to find and interact with them10/10 would be a stalker again
This game is crap There are people in it that can shoot you when you are crouched behind a corner with bullets that can appearently turn 90 degrees mid flight and hit you when you are crouched behind a wall far around the corner. This of course verified with the Kill Cam. Not sure if its a better attempt at what Dayz started or if I prefer Dayz although both seem to be in the same catagory of unfinished possibly neverendingly unfinished and buggy. What annoys especially with a game I dont care much to play anymore after all this is the constant massive updates and then the recent addition of the 26.2 mb update every 4 hours it seems not sure if this 26.2mb update is just needed every 4 hours to fix something the developers messed up with one of the daily 9 GB patches you have for the game. They update so much with the game so often they lose track of where they messed up what it seems. So now they need this 26.2mb update every 4 hours or more to keep the servers going or something kicking the can on a problem they can't seem to resolve at its source. Don't buy into all the hype.
Management . every time i play so many laggs. Doesnt worth is money
DOnt buy this piece of u just get rekt by fgts.
The lag and stuttering is terrible. I have a relatively new computer that can not handle this game in its lowest settings. During firefights the game freezes and jumps making it very difficult to do well.
after the recent update the game is stuck at initialising before the lobby if by some miracle i get in the lobby and play one match as soon as the match ends it must initialise again hence i sit with the problem again
Great Game guys just has a problem with lagg but nothing that cant be fixed
POS BROKEN PLEASE FIX
Most favourite game
EAC error 23 plus EasyAntiCheat not installable unable to play.
Fun game if it was optimized. GARBAGE servers constant desync lag/rubber banding and sub par physics optimization make almost every experience you have in this game frustrating and unenjoyable. Will update review if they every get this together. Shoudlve spent their topurnament money on better devs..
Great survival game. Very hard though and you must have patience . Use Code KEEM to get 10% off Gfuel. #DramaAlert. 10/10 says IGN
Chased a naked guy for 5 minutes just to get killed by a friend of his.10/1011/10 Would chase a naked guy again.#NotCreepyAtAll
Best Game of 2015. Still getting updated to this day.
It is a good game can be boring by yourself.
the bigger the pee pee the greater the power.
is whack. only good when playing with friends. fix this
Solo is an anxiety simulator.
Great game. But wasteland is ing ruining Ranked.
was very fun tell i played official and ran into a ton of hackers and bought hacks myself to try and play aginst them
This game is one of my all time favorite games for the computer!
Great game!
I thought this game looked ridiculous and stupid. Now it's one of my all time favorite games. 10/10
Has great potential but in just 8 hours I was killed on sight by a community.
Such a fun game been playing it almost everyday since I bought it.
Worst netcode of any shooter I have ever played.Cannot recommend until they implement decent networking.
You know why this has a bad review.
Great game made by some amazing developers with loads of free content constantly being released. A game I will never get tired of and I will constantly play for years to come.
This runs like complete garbage.
ing trash but addictive.
Just get this game
Absolute trash only game that causes connection lag. sick of it never had the problem when i started playing and now ive had it all this year.
Steaming pile of
I bought this game and refunded it. Then i felt I didnt give it a fair chance and repurchased it. Was I ever the fool.This game is absolutely terrible on just about every level.The hit detection is br&gt The pace of the game is utterly boring. The amount of time I've spent actively seeking players and never finding any only to be shot by some chinese hacker or some one 1KM away with a large zooming scope just kills the vibe.Physics. What physics? They make no sense.The playerbase is cancerDid i mention the chinese hackers? Get top 5 and die to a chinese hacker.The random loot. Oh its really random! Let me search 20 ing houses to find nothing but pistols. Need an Red dot or a scope? Na bruh have a bunch of shotguns.Major issues with every patch. Either the lobby is broken the game mechanics are broken optimization etc.I'm sure i missed so much more things about this game.
Product received for free. love the game keep GOING ROCKSTAR
gg
used to be a very fun gameit's worse now but that can be helped if devs focus on fixing the game and its bugs rather than adding more bad contentwe dont want paid for crates and sanhok passesfix the bugs
HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS THIS GAME WILL BE DEAD IN 2 MONTHSLETS GO BACK TO LEAGUE!!!!
The performance of this game is so terrible many bugs... but this is model i like
This is one of those games that you will continue to play over the years. Also since Rockstar is pumping out fresh content all the time for this it is always fresh and you will always have something to do. The new stunts dlc is probably my favourite dlc i have ever downloaded for any game. Definetely worth a go.
good game
Got this game since the day it came out really into to it now. Even better with friends!
get into gameget killedstop playingplay againrepeat
Amazingly Fun to play with friends the Hex Ruin
Oh hello there you're about to buy this game and spend more money and waste your life on it? well today is the day where i tell you do not purchase because you will be banned if you play fair. save your money today. I'm dissapointed i played this game since day 1 transfered from an old console to PC and then i get told i wasted my time and i get everything wiped. Dissapointed in you rockstar.
Awesome gameplay except some bugs(because it's early access) great game to play with friends
You are honestly better off torrenting/pirating this game. Not only because Rockstar will ban you for an FoV mod but because this over hyped game and developer doesn't deserve the $60 that people wasted just to get banned.2/10 Game got progressively worse over the time it was released
Take two.... you failed miserably with the all OpenIV thing... I'm really disapointed.Mods were the only thing that could have made me play this game again... well not anymore
Awsome game sofar.

Veri guud
The game is fun but servers are too busy rubberbanding lag and allot of speed hackers bluehole really need to fix their
This game is a lot of fun. I'd put it up on top games list. Can't wait to see what the beta and subsequent actual game release will look like. It's already complex and enjoyable.
"PUBG is a game that I've played quite a bit of and I've enjoyed almost all of what I've played. But the problem is almost all of that enjoyment has come from playing with friends. Solo this is one of the worst multiplayer games I've played. Weapons I've realized after playing for a while that there is really not that much variety in weapons. Basically you can use either a shotgun (which are all the same) an assault rifle (which are all the same) or a sniper rifle (which to be fair actually have variances in feel between the 3 available). There are technically also pistols melee weapons smg's and a crossbow but they're all useless. Melee is broken pistols do nothing the crossbow is just like a sniper rifle that can't use a good scope and smg's are just worse assault rifles. ""But"" I hear you asking ""what if you can't find a good gun then you could use one of those."" No. If you land in an area with more than 1 house 9 times out of 10 you'll find at least a rifle and a shotgun. Speaking of which there isn't really ever a reason to use anything other than 1 shotgun and 1 sniper or if you can't find one an AR. Loot The loot system is more than anything frustrating. Most of any given game will turn into looking through houses to find the 1 or 2 pieces of usable loot per house. A gun here some meds there maybe you get lucky and get that elusive level 3 helmet or vest but it's never exciting because you know that by the end of the game your loot's probably going to be the exact same as it always is give or take a few meds that you won't need because you already hgave so many. The game just throws loot at you to the point that you will always have everything as long as you don't die within the first 3 or 4 minutes. The only real difference from game to game is your scopes. To the game's credit scopes can make a huge difference and are relatively rare. If you get near the end and you have a x8 scope and the other team only has a x4 you'll have a big advantage.Combat Like I said earlier melee combat is completely broken. If you land near somebody it will every time turn into both of you jumping around hitting each other hoping that you get lucky and your hits actually register. In actual gunfights this is much better but the problem is that if you're only in solos you'll rarely actually have these. Most games in solos and many games in duos end with you getting shot from someone you can't see and dying before you can tell where they are. Only in squads where you have 3 or preferably 4 pairs of eyes to look will you get into full fledged coordinated fights. On the plus side shooting is the one thing in this game that actually feels smooth and responsive. Also as much as I'm painting a picture of the game being all luck there are still always a decent amount of head on shootouts in most games. And when you're in squads the gunplay and fights are as much fun as you'll ever have in a game.General Complaints The game is incredibly clunky. Every single thing you do other than shooting feels like it should feel better to do. Especially noteworthy are parachuting down jumping driving moving and looting. These things happpen to encompass most of the game. Which brings me to the core problem of the game you don't really do anything most of the time. This is the biggest reason you need friends to play with for the game to be any good because if you don't the game will just be one big slog where you're running on autopillot until you see another person. You drop down look for a gun kill anyone near you once you find one continue looking for scopes and armor and meds go to wherever the zone goes and then repeat steps 3 and 4 until there are less than 10 people left and the zone's small. At that point it's a toss up wether you'll have a super fun intense few minutes while you fight to the death or you'll get shot in the back of the head by a sniper rifle and die before you can do anything. Overall I'd say only buy this game if you have good friends who you are 100% sure you can and will play with for a while."
Game is trash and runs like trash.
Fortnite sucks
They banned my friend for no reason within three hours meanwhile every other session has a hacker that s with me. Great game but you rockstar.
Very nice game just not easy to run on alot of PC's.
Is running like butter at 60 FPS on my GTX 770 at Very High settings. I think Rockstar has finally done it with GTA PC ports. Though it took 2 years I am glad they made us wait rather than push out a POS. Get it and experience all GTA V has to offer!
yes
Fun game but so badly plagued by cheaters (aimbot wallhack) it's impossible to play.
recoil
Still love it it became repetitive tho.
It's well madeGreat PC menu and optimalization FPS lock up to 240 FPS and can customize graphics settings to last detailThis also applies to Camera and Quick chat settingsGameplay wise It's really refined not too bugy what I can say for what it is it can't be done much betterBut I have to warn This game still has chance of corrupting your save file altough it can be fixed you'll still lose some statsAlso Server performance is poor often you get high ping from server and it can barerly handle 6 players.
Best game I've played thus far and it only getting better with every update!
Good single player story with lots of stuff to do until you 100% it and then decide to play online as online is the only mode that is still supported with this game. Then we come to why this review is a downvote which is the online experience is awful in its current state every lobby is filled with ethier trolls or hackers that can't be killed or have unlimited money and cheats and will kill you instantly with said cheats along with the ability to kick you from lobbies. Combined with the crappy customer support that bans players that dont even cheat and will not negotiate the ban even if it were to be a mistake. The online is also ruined by it being designed around shark card microtransactions as everything is so expensive and you earn money so slow you almost have to spend real world money in order to unlock any new features that are added in a reasonable amount of time. Final Verdict If you want a good singleplayer game get this on sale when its less than $15 $20 and if you are wanting a good multiplayer experinece just skip this game and spend your money elsewhere.
"I preloaded and installed the game but now if I want to play it the launcher just wont start.It says ""preparing to launch GTA V"" and then it closes.Please help!"
Fun game moving around is a bit slow though
Way better than console version! Population and Vehicle density is a dream. However online play loading times are a pain... still worth it though!
Forces people online due to no modding A grind to get cash no single player dlc I honestly have doubts on the new Red dead redemption.... you Take Two Interactive
My first game as a killer and all the survivors was high elo poor matchmaking
nice game potato server
It's pretty much a dumbed down free for all version of the King of the hill mod made from the same author of this game.It gets old pretty fast and it doesn't feels like a game on its own barely worth 30 euros/dollars. Refunded
Entertaining every time I get a chance to play. If you have friends I bet it would be even better. I don't have friends that will play this with me but picking on people online is pretty great too!so much great DLC
"Product received for free. HELP ME!!!!! My GTA V GET A STUCK ""Files required to play GTA Online could not be downloaded from the rockstar games service"". Anyone can give me a solution ? i have so many thing but still didn't work!!"
Worth the wait.
Soccer and cars 11/10 would hit the crossbar 100 times again!
"Great game easily the best $20 I've ever spent on a game. This game does the ""Easy to play Hard to master"" concept GREAT! The high skill cap means you get to see yourself constantly improve and get better. And a good ranking system to help keep track of your progress. Also literally no P2W in this game which is a huge pet peeve of mine. All items are just for looks!"
Great game for 2 3 match per day. And somethimes its takes to long kill other player when you die in 1 3 shot
Muito show!!
I do not recommend this game it has bad tick rate and latency it stutters alot especially whenever I enter combat. Not saying I would win every fight but I'd win a lot more if this game ran smoothly. Constant rubberbanding. A lot of hackers. Playing with randoms is awful in duos I'm on NA servers why do I have such a hard time being paired with someone who speaks english either that or their game crashes. It is just a giant mess right now. I want them to offer some region locked servers so I can narrow down who is going to be on my team I want to play with someone who speaks english so we can communicate and cordinate. Sure some players don't have mics but if they can understand me it would still be better than no communication at all.
Excellent Game Developers constantly Update it!
best gameeee everrrrrrr
Seriousley fix your physics
Product received for free. game is bad and you can not customize your character
Gotta say that I am pretty disappointed with the early release of this game out of early access. It was certainly not ready for the 1.0 release. That aside the lack of support for their non hacker community is asounding. Just MAC ban people. It will stop alot of cheating as other games have demonstrated.
Product received for free. Nice
Game is good but if you don't have a time to play a lot you will lost everything what you have got.If in the server are playing rich guys you have no chances to defend your loot. It is waste of time.
PING TOO HIGH
So much ing hackers... Entered a session which has 5 hackers at the same time couldn't report them because rockstar doesn't LET ME REPORT TOO MUCH LIKE THEY CAN ING PREVENT HACKERS! 10000/10 would NOT recommend.
++++
Great game but changes seem slow lots of money is going into this game and I don't feel a lot is coming out. The new map is good and so is vaulting but its not game changing.
the new map is very good! keep it up!!
cheaters
I don't mind about missions and in fact I am enjoying it but if the devs are to provide us a mission with specific map they should've let us choose the map. Because everytime I hit the different map I quit then try for rematch until I get what I want which is obviously waste of time.Btw I love the new map Mini royal adds speed to the game without leaving its core.
Where Monster Hunter World improved on the old and traditional monster hunting formula by simplifying aspects of gameplay exploration and crafting it also created many more flawed game design conflicts.When an MH game start to hold your hands through the beginning levels and making tutorials that are unnecessarily long you know that the newest instalment in a long running franchise is catered to casuals. However I actually like it as it serves as a good entry point to the franchise and is quite accessible to many players. Adding fuel to the fire the story is also really stupid boring pointless and extremely forgettable with unskippable cutscenes it is absolutely ridiculous.Further frustration however comes from the game itself with the server disconnecting every 10 minutes confusing and non sensical co op / multiplayer with a questionable PC optimization.The game is designed to be played in co op as upon selecting your save file you are immediately given the options to join multiplayer create a session or join a friend's session. Joining the session does not put you in a shared hub meaning you cannot see other players in the same session thus have any interactions unlike previous MH games. To participate in a quest one has to post a mission and others has to run to the nearest quest board to accept it rather than just having it appear on the screen as you are already in the same session. Even when all 4 players joined the quest but did not select ready the quest starter will depart on the job by themselves and others has to then depart individually to the same session.Participation on main story missions requires everyone to first start the mission solo and play up to the point of encountering the boss and trigger the cutscenes associated with it. The players then need to quite the mission in order to join the story mission together. Otherwise the game will tell you either that you have not progressed enough into the story to participate (When you clearly has) or the host has not finished the cutscenes and you cannot join. On top of this the constant disconnects (or should I say random?) from the server will automatically kick you out of the multiplayer session and you either have to join again or play solo leaving an essential aspect of MH working smoothly only half of the time which ultimately ruins the fun of the game.Did I also mention that under full screen the game forces big picture mode which replaced the traditional steam overlay meaning you have to alt+tap out in order to talk with friends. Ridiculous.As far as co op goes the game is not fit for purpose and currently half broken. However IGN and many other outlets seem to say otherwise.But hey at least I can run the game smoothly...(Buy it with caution and Capcom fix your !!!)
this game is absolute trash now i wasted 3k hours and it got ruined by a dev called helk ing roleplayer if you want a survival game thats good just play minecraft.
I waited several months post release to buy this game because I wanted to be sure the PC port is solid. And it was. And I paid $60. And I got my solid 60fps. And all was great.And then several weeks later RockStar released patch 1.28. And now performance is and the entire point of buying the PC port has gone moot for me. How they managed to screw that up is beyond me.I miss the time when I could choose which patch I wanted to install. Oh wait I still can by buying on GOG.comEdit Ok after 2 weeks another patch was released and now performance is back to normal and I'm happy again. Great game. But don't trust RockStar...
"""But can we copystrike pewdiepie?"" Good money Good Game"
Was decend fun untill they decided to completely stop all modding. Won't be playing this sh** anymore.EDIT 24.6Apparently Open 4 was allowed to continue development.
Maça hebun did not like this...
No.
DEAR BLUEHOLE!!! IF YOU ARE READING THIS PLEASE BRING US OPTIMIZATION!!!
it sucks
i love the game because there is nothing more annoying then when you play the killer and you get infinite looped by player all because if they start infinite looping cars or windows you cant catch them and then have to chase another player just to get infinite looped again please do something about it like allow the killer to have a extened swing range so they cant infinite loop around cars or trash cans or allow killer to jump on to cars because its so annoying when your having fun as the killer and then the surivors use the infinite looping on the killers it make the game unfair but other then that its a great game
Split Screen Online with my bro rekt some ps4 n00bs.10/10 IGNWould play again.

Nice game but need more optimise
i want my money back
Dead by daylight is a fun game.. An on the edge of your seat kind of game... I give it a 8 10
Received Error Code 22 on EAC Startup.Can no longer enjoy any servers/game in general.No one has any guides or fixes posted on the interwebs as well.10/10 game is unplayable now.
I want to love it i really do. The singleplayer is great theres lots of things to do. However i feel like its basically turned into an FPS they dont care about singleplayer at all anymore (They have added 0 things to multiplayer since launch).While multiplayer gets stuff every month and further more is much more polished.I really wouldnt mind but its all pay to play. I have to spend an extra 100 dollars just to get enough money to buy the new stuff. And its really not even that good to be honest its all just vehicals and the dificulty is artificialy bumped up (The npcs get massive unfair health boost even when it doesnt make sence and theyre guns are basically insta kill) And you cant farm money (You have to do 24/7 if you even wanted to buy 1 thing).And furthermore the staff suck you get banned for singleplayer mods and even if you havent changed the game even a littletheres a constant risk of getting banned and your account (including those 100 dollars you used on money) deleted.And its EXTREMELY rare that you actually get a reply from rockstar.Heres a tip if you really want to play it buy the base game. No DLC (its all multiplayer) or 'cards' and perferably on a steam sale.Dont waste money on this game.
went to a rads town and got held up at gunpoint.6 or 7 people came out of nowhere and took me to there base.They then built a cage around me and called me there pet.10/10
One of the best games I've played in my life.
Awesome game! great way to waste time. Although the online has its issues.
Good
"this game had such great potential. its advertised as co op yet multiplayer isnt available for any of the story missions or main campaign...what a swift kick in the balls. Me and my good friend had been debating to get this game as we heard it was a fun yet ""casual"" co op game. well i hate to break it to anyone out there that wants to get into dicord with your friends and fight things together...it wont happen in monster hunter world. its only co op for non related story missions. just a big disapointment and idk who came up with the idea to make half the game single player and the other half co op..no fun. and the starting tutorial takes WAAAAAAAAAAY too long my god. such a let down."
Totally worth the money all over again and it always will be. Visually graphically and mentally.
什么时候让我开个小裙子才给好评
Better than H1Z1
ANOTHER GAME.. PAY TO WIN
Considering it's only an alpha this game is great fun and you can play for hours. Can't wait to see it evolve and get even better!
Product received for free. Great Game.
IVE PLAYED 200 HRS AT LEAST ITS A GOOD GAME BUT I CANT GET INTO THE GAME ANYMORE PSYONIX FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
One of my favorite games of all time! Played it on PS3 PS4 and PC and i'm still not tired of it.
heli scary
Game 5/5 Playing experience 2/5While the game itself is excellent in its simplicity (a bunch of people scavenging for weapons and going at it with the last one(s) remaining the winner) it would be even better if it actually worked relatively well. Small bugs that make you run while blinking back a couple of paces now and again are annoying but now not even that incomplete gaming experience is availabe as servers are offline.In short the game itself is excellent (at least during the early access phase it was). It does not run smoothly though and we probably have millions of patches (as usual) to look forward to... Yay...Anyone interested in buying this game would probably do well to wait a few months as the game is nearly unplayable at times at the moment. When it IS playable however it is one of the most exciting and addictive games out there. Regardless of whether you like 1st person shooters or not.I recommend this game to everyone... ...when it's finally ready in a few months.
Best game
"The very beginning is always hard. I know ive started on my own too. But there are always nice and fun people on a server. Finding them is the difficult part but not impossible. And remember newbies not every ing is friendly just because you said ""im friendly"". Life's tough get over it and kill that dude when he opened his door to his base. Thats what keeps me going atleast. Killing everyone and eating their meat whilst singing poetry om ams 2 server ). Have fun and may the odds be in your favor."
After 2 years of constant failures to load on 3 machines 4 hard/solid/hybrid drives I finally discovered that merely running DXDIAG fixes it. I've played a bit since and it's fun but I think it lost me a couple of years back. I'll keep working through and try to complete it it's a great game but yeah if I knew the problems I would have I wouldn't have bought it. I'll rate it up because the game is good and my experience doesn't reflect the majority. Gameplay wise it's amazing. Just one damned bug that took two years to ID.
Great little game A friend got it for me as a gift I am now hooked on it This is the only game that I can say When you get killed and looted Its well worth it Thanks for the Free XP Lads! This game has some pesky idiots about but you can just go and destroy all their hard work So all in all it's Good.9/10 Will be killed againUpdate The game is toxic as ever but is still worth getting I would strongly suggest playing with friends and not solo the devs continue to update the game and add new features it just never gets old.The game systems have changed around but now the XP system has been replaced its still great.
Terribly unrealistic shooting mechanics. You can unload an entire clip of rifle ammo into someone without even downing them. It's laughable they want this to be an eSport when the game is in this state.
Amazing game!
take two. enough said.
Very fun and tense game to play with friends
Nice game im level 9
Very good game
"This game is the epitome of Early Access games. Pay 30 dollars get crap servers crap balancing and even crap rendering. It's such a crap bargain! It's amazing that it's sold as well as it has and has the hype it does. It's the kind of game that just screams ""I'll never be a final release!"" They'll try polishing it up over about 2 years but the final release will never come if it does it will still be lackluster compared to any real developer created FPS game. That being said if it was around 15 dollars it would be worth the purchase just to see what facing 100 players crapping around one map feels like. It was hard the first 10 hours getting used to it kind of fun for about 20 hours and then when you realize how horribly balanced it is you just start to spend more time playing other games because this one pisses you off. I will say that the only fun part is the first few times you get to the last 10 or so people because you get that adrenaline rush from being so close to the top and the tension is real. Overall I'd rate it 6/10. It has a lot of room for improvement and hell if they actually finished the game to the extent 2017 games SHOULD be made then it will be something to look twice at. Until then Buyer Beware!"
Çok fazla hileci olmaya başladı önlem de almıyorlar.
the game is a waist of $20 you just get chased by bears for a few hours until you find out that they will go away by standing on top of a wooden platform then 5 seconds after you escape them WOLF ATTACK and you realize you are out of wood and you cant stop to get any so then your running for another few hours then some bears kindly join the wolves on their pursuit then hours later finally escape them then a guy shoots you and takes all your stuff you spent hours to get then hes saying mean things to you in the chat and saying how much you suck at the game
Most fun I've had playing a game in a while. Grinning ear to ear the whole time.
this game is actually terribleh1z1 is free to play if you want to play a hacker ridden game with sweaties just go there lmao
Other negative reviews summarize the whole thing perfectly. Do not buy this game unless you're planning to instantly refund it or you'll basically be forced to play it until you get enough crates to make back the money you spent buying this excuse for a game.
Damn Fun game but you will rage quit hardcore!!!. And then jump back in in 5 minutes cuz its so funGame needs some more graphical optimaztion but no major problems
i just simply love this game
"I bought this game on PC hyped to get to finally play the years of work on Xbox 360 and Xbox One I put in for my character on PC and they decided to claim my 25 million of real money I spent months working for as ""modded money"". Then after I recieved unwanted modded money after that recent procceded to reset my character that I spent 4 years building up since GTA Online first launched and ban me for a month. I would not reccomend buying this game for GTA Online or Singleplayer GTA V is dying and stuff like this that happened to me is just making more people leave the game and the singleplayer is not worth it they wanted to focus so much on GTA Online that they cancelled all the future DLCs for Singleplayer. I loved this game before all of this happened that I did not deserve and would not reccomend playing it unless you got it for free."
Хорошая игра по скидке берите!!!
I think that this game is fun for mucking around with friends and in general has great visuals and allows people to come back and continually plsy. However in saying this for someone who takes this game seriously will dislike this game due to the many flaws that some of the modes such as the third person mode provides such as being seen from around the corner. Other game breaking glitches such as spawning from the airplane being able to not see any buildings and rocks allowing the person to drive vehicles through a apartment building killing a person who is looting for weapons. Overall this game is great and fun when playing for fun and taking it casually but i would not recommend it to a person who wants to take this game seriously.
suspended in the first 57 mintues great
good game and i recommand it ! that was..... 2 yars ago )) ... now... online .... jesus you cannot enjoy it... in 1 or 2 hours some modder gonna kill you.. you cargo ...and make you lose a lot of your work... not Worth it... NEVER AGAIN gonna buy ROCKSTAR !!!! no mather what game they gonna make... just by principle i will not buy any nomather what you telling me you make MILLIONS of dollars with this game.. but you are not willing to invest some money in it's security ? it's a joke
10/10 would sniff again multiple times!
垃圾游戏无语了 无缘无故封我号 去你妈的 你会和h1Z1一样凉
Rockstar you need to control the modders and hackers because they're just ruining the game for everyone else. Second If I buy a upgrade and remove it. I should get a refund and not have to rebuy the stupid upgrade I already paid $250 000 for. Your in game items are over priced as and the missions dont pay well enough to afford anything. Between the game being $60 and then shark cards this game is ruined. You better not up red dead redemption like this or I'm not gonna buy another game from you guys because it's just toxic to own a game from your company. Fix your hacking protection.
yes and no it really depends on the server
gave me bum aids
Great as i expected just the loading times could be improved
If you really like it when your game crashes suddenly gameplay is choppy and you die constantly this might be the game for you. You'll smash your head against the wall and tell yourself you'll never play again because why or more importantly how could a game cause you this much frustration.Unfortunately though you'll click Play... again and again until you've wasted hundreds or more likely thousands of hours.
this game is ing good
Love hate relationship.
i hate this game
Goodbye World Goodbye DayZ Hello Rust!

Great game. Only slight annoyance is the story missions revolve around telling your friend to wait till the cut scene is over before letting them join don't quite get why they couldn't go the route of forcing all players to watch it/skip it but it will only plague the first few hours of the game and even then it is not as big a deal as everyone makes it out to be. Once the cut scene is over you can hop right in with them.
BEST GAME EVERY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Better than FARTNITE
Hacker online. Not friendly for peole who want to play in Co OP. waste of en money. story mode is fine but after that boring
full of hackers
So good
so many cheater in online game immortal and invisible man so I really mad about this..so if u (GTA 5) wanted life longer please fix this bugs....!!!!!!!!and I cannot play with my friend in the online game when I start the mission at the club my friend was left always happen.and I get boring about this..!!
10/10 would recommend
This Game is really good except you have damn survivors complaing but besides that im not here to write a whole paragragh so if you like F13 The Game this is better or just as good.

This game is awesome!
Need more optimization

Incredible heart pumping hand throbbing gameplay.Amazing audio for gunshots localisation (where's the guy shooting at you).Ruthless survival.
Love Monster Hunter played since the first one. This game is great! Wish they had as many monsters as they did in the hand held games as well as G rank. Feels like it was lazy of the devs.
The game is amazing! Time Killer.
Buggy hit registration ridiculous randomness poor performance. Every second update breaks the game. Tons of cheaters. I don't recommed this game unless you enjoy suffering.
Greatest game of a generation best played on pc.
This game is good its really is and kinda realistic and all that br&gt but this game has alot of stupid bugs that dont ven mae sence like sometimes players are jumping out of the cars in like 30 KM and nothing happends to them but when i get out of the car and the car rolls in 5 KM and knocks me uts kinda dumb. the hitboxes are not fully done yet.. but overall this game is awesome and very funny sonetimes with frinds

ADORO ROCKET LEAGUE D
This game is quite awesome but the loading times for Online is just way too long. Hope for a fix. Also a lot of connections issues when joining Mission sesions.
Was good until you TF2'd it. I miss SARPBC.
Getting rid of OpenIV just put you guys in a really deep hole. Have fun with a loss of playerbase take two. F*** you.UPDATE Thanks for bringing back OpenIV.
Got chicken breasts off of a bear i killed with a gun i stole from an empty house.11/10
This is way better than fornite i dont understand why people say it is. This is the most realalistic battle royal game that has ever came out and will ever come out. PUBG is the best game on steam and will stay that way for a long time.
Poorly optimized with 1070
Best Game Ever!
It's a really fun and competive game
Sweet baby jesus this game is legit. ya i agree
great game and fun having no story just do what ever u want to do
It's RL... Getgud
This game is a prime example of how to lose fans in less than a day.
Saw some youtubers playing it when it was in beta and thought it looked great. Bought it and not regretted a single penny as it is probably one of the most addictive fun games I can keep playing it for hours without getting bored. Great to play to with friends and has plenty of options if you want to play with AI or even to practice getting used to the controls. I would definitely recommended playing with a controller as it is the only way to perform flying hits.Possiblly the best 14 I've paid for a game. If you love football with cars then this is the best game with hours of endless fun! Love the fact they keep adding new game modes and maps too.
So I tried this game with mouse and keyboard and I ing hated it. I decided to give it another chance now that I have a controller and its one of the funnest games ever.
"I am not a hardcore gamer by any means...but not a fan. I am having fun playing with a ""friend"" but hackers are super annoying and are total fun suckers. I've had a jet engine put around my waist had a girl appear on my back been wasted so many times. Le sigh. The hacking though...kinda takes the fun out of it. My original review was a total thumbs down...but it does have it's good moments."
good game nice looking rock
This game is great! It is very fun and allows to do a lot in one mode. It is like a better Garry's mod!
Just one more match please? (If you like soccer/football and cars.... and Need For Speed boost grab a copy. Worth the price.
after price hike id stear clear
The only reason I bought this game initially was to mod it. I then decided to return it because my computer couldn't handle it and I have been waiting to build a beefier rig. So Congratz Take Two You just got rid of my only reason to re purchase this game. #freeOpenIV
"Game is fun but the netcode is pretty bad (I've seen on the killcam a guy aiming about 6 centimeters behind me and getting a headshot) and the devs seem to not care at all what the community thinks about the ""insane number of chinese cheaters and teamkillers overruning the North American servers."" (although I've personally only encountered one obvious cheater and I've never played anything except solo since my friends don't want to get the game (yet))Region lock needs to be a thing and the devs are in the stone age for not implementing it yet and until they do I'll keep this a negative review."
It'd be a great game if rockstar focussed on the single player rather than multiplayer...but I guess that's not gonna happen since it's obvious which one makes more $$$....................../ /) .................... / ../ .................../..../ ............./ /'...'/ ........../'/.../..../......./ ........('(... ... .... /'...') ......... .................'...../ ..........''... .......... _. ............ ..............( .............. ............. ... ROCKSTAR
Great game for anyone who actually likes shooters. This isn't your standrard bs Call of Duty game it's raw and realistic (to a point). Your heart rate will eventually go down after the first time you're hiding and someone finds you before you find them. The only real way to win this game is to be tactful and stragetic with your movements. The map (there is only one right now) takes a while to learn I would suggest looking up some youtube videos to get ahead of the game. Everyone has their different stragetics. I would suggest joining the discord channel that's linked on the /r/puBATTLEGROUNDS subreddit. Easy to hop into a match and find team mates along with advise if you want to seek it out. There is an automatching service in the game but there's a 50/50 chance your team mate will just track you down and kill you since the reporting system is a shell in it's current state.Perfect 5/7 in it's current state. It's still an EAG so expect server issues and bugs. The Dev's really haven't gotten a good process on bringing the system back up quickly after emergency maintenance but I would bet every time they have issues they're figuring out what went wrong so that if it does happen again impact will be less.
this game is
Simply put skyrim with fewer available mods+ game doesn't crash anymore due to 150 installed mods I want to install 150 mods ...
This game... Is so awesome...AND its in alpha! I hope when its finished to be MORE awesome!
It's a love hate relationship.
zzzzzzz....
Yes.
compeletely waste of time. you'll probably play against at least one cheater per game.
Nice game
I cant play pugb plaease help me
Honestly GTA V is one of the most in depth creative AAA open world games of the last decade and the amount of effort Rockstar still puts in to support an over 3 year old game today is astounding. It's absolutely worth the price of admission.
Awesome Game! Still needs some work on ranged shots and is a bit choppy sometimes.
"Im having some trouble... just bought a new gaming computer and dowloaded gta! when i run it my screen goes black for a lot of time and i can only hear the background music. What may be the problem? is there an ingame download like on ps3/4? or should everything be completed once the ""main download"" is complete?"
Here for the steam badge also its a fun game.
I'm a macho man yet in this game I'm a sweet little naked girl.
Apart from the current lack of content that I'll forgive due to early access tho Early Access is starting to look like almost as bad an idea as Kickstarter for games lately only here you get to see what you've done immediately this game has one problem I cannot forgive ignore or even remotely enjoy the game due to.People are bloody awful.I died in less than a minute the first dozen or so servers I tried then for the first three hours after that some dude would always kill me the minute I got food a tool and started on my home. Now I might be able to deal with the pain that is other people if they were just an added challenge but they aren't. People are voices. PEople are persistant. People are evil.And this game has produced some weird kind of evil at that. Day Z is downright friendly in comparison and CoD voice chat a cheerful conversation in the quad. That said that could (probably is) the very reason many people like this game so perhaps I might've recommended it instead but that would leave an even worse taste in my mouth than playing it.
E sports ready.10/10 would let Kara still my loot again.
Good job on ruining a good game.
Product received for free. nice game
My name is PUBG. I'm a game. I'm a performance game. I was bought by people to fulfill their fantasies their deep dark fantasies...
Best game )
It's just SO GOOD!
Great Game but skill judging is completely broken and so is matchmakingPlease work on this
very good game everything is meant for a purpose well balanced and fredy is annoying and
"Games fun but half the damn time the buildings wont load properly getting me killed. And before you say ""get a better pc"" my pc is far better than whats needed to run this game. Fix. Your. Game."
nice game to play with friends
other than the ocasion game breaking glitches i love this game and happily wait for updates
Combine rockets cars technology and soccer (football) and your result is this fun chaotic game. Though people usually get paired with people of higher or lower experience making a round either a bit unfar or easier. I this most likely that I'm terrible. Besides this it's still a great game.
Best AFK game for FPS nabs ever? I don't ever actively play and only run after blue zones. Don't care about the competitive aspect because I suck so hard 90% I get killed by the first person that sees me. I just let it run in the background once I've found my spot then move a bit once blue zone comes kill a person or two every 100 games if I'm lucky and that other player suck more than me. Good times if you really don't care. But according to other reviews yeah maybe stay away from this if you like FPS shooting and winning a lot.
a game made by the devil
I LOVE this game!!! However I am writing this Review today to address the issue of the bobbing camera while running. It is making me dizzy and nauseous and I am finding it difficult to play for more than a few minutes at a time. This is the only game that I actually have to aim my character in a direction CLOSE MY EYES and then start running lol! Or aim at a tree run up to it and start hacking WITH MY EYES CLOSED. Humorously I've actually gotten pretty good at timing it. But I would like to not have to resort to this tactic. OVERALL GREAT GAME!!!!
good game... i guess
Queues for a match with a full squad Entire squad loads in except you You try to land near them based on when they say it and fail since you cannot see You land in a building with 1/3 of the server in it Squad blames you for dying Game crashesIf you can look past the bugs the game is very fun. Highly recommend it if Fortnite isn't your thing and you want a Battle Royale. Could use a price drop though.
I would like to start by saying that I discovered Rocket League this year but it quickly became one of my favourite game. It's such a good game to play with friends ( I can't really recommend it without them). The mechanics are not the easiest to learn and there will be times when a team comes and just destroys you but believe me it makes the game more fun.The soundtrack of is good and it gives rhythm to the game and even though I usually don't listen to this type of games I can enjoy it while playing.The graphics of the game are good normal I would say they are not jaw dropping but neither unplayable.The microtransactions are there but they don't really influence the game maybe there are a few cars with better hit boxes but the difference won't mean much on a lower level.I can't really find any cons so I'm going to give a 9/10 ( it just needs a little bit more to become a perfect Game).
ok
The Sun RisedTook Tommy to the beachTommy's skin was hard from the woundsHe looked pale and maybe abit greyBut he soon filled in the colour redAs I turned him around he was drenchedBlood from a naked man whom had his wiener outI realize Tommy was the ultimate weaponMade for Death and Destruction10/10 would take Tommy to the beach again
I haven't played that much but from what I've seen I give this title a solid 5 out of 7.
rocket league seems stupid but is extremly addictive and fun once you get into it. it an awsome game and an amazing time waster
This game is just not for me would suggest it's best place is on console.I found the game is too open you somethimes feel like what should I be doing now ..... disaapponting for the price.
gud
u know u want this game
not bad
Even though I would recommend this game to everyone I know the cases that you now get (without choice) that you need a key for a starting to me off. Have gotten 4 locked ones in a row in the last week. I loved this game before because there was no microtransactions but now with the damn cases you cant get anything (that decent) without buying 100$ worth of keys. 5/9 chance to get one that doesnt have a lock isnt good at all. If this is gonna happen at least make it 2/9 or 3/9. Please dont me off pubg I really like you and dont wanna have to be fustrated.
fun game.
Thats really addictive game! Lots of fun and freedom in each figure. For me its the best survival ever made! So if you like cooperation challenges and beautiful landscapes ASAP buy it and play for many hours!
It's pretty fun I guess
REGION LOCK CHINAIMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY EVEN ON SOUTH AMERICAN SERVERS CHEATERS EVERYWHERE AND IN EVERY GAME
RIP mods
Created my character went and bought a mask robbed a store with a pistol that had no ammo store clerk noticed gun was empty and shot me several times then i went home to play GTA and it was pretty great. 13/10

Dont buy this Take two interactive is screwing it over with the online gameplay and anti modding policys.

Use a controller expect to grind not the most detail for graphics yet super needy but i got a 1070 playing on 4k and got no issues.All in all this game is great! Hope mods come out one day itll be amazing.
This game has taught me to knock out with a gun and beat the poor bastard to death with a frying pan while berating himAlso FIX THE ING SERVERS. I SWEAR ITS LIKE THE CHINESE ARE INVADING US SERVERS.
Addicting
My girl is due in a few weeks and I'm gonna name her Rocket League
Product received for free. Nice Graphic Pls Downspec for me.......................... ((((((
A really fun game now that the servers are fixed would definetely reccomend to any battle royale type game fans.
gud geam 9/11 denk i rekomendos
This is by far my favorite of the GTA franchise not only because of the incredible level of detail put into the game but how versatile it is. Well suited for modders who want to mod single player but also public Role play servers.I would highly recommend this game to my friends or anyone who likes video games.
This is the only game where a group of naked men can sit around a fire by night and then rock eachother to death by day.5/5
Graphics are nowhere near as good as they should be for the hardware demands. Even fully cranked it just doesn't look great. Hit registration is ing awful. Maps are already boring after a few days. Very bland. The crates are exactly like CS GO but without the actual $$ trading value that CS GO offers. It's just one big stupid ripoff for a poor chance at a terrible selection of cosmetic t. Concept was boring in Arma 3 and really though the team ques really helped it's still boring as hell. I really can't believe there are so many people playing this game. It's really just not that great. Lots and lots of people but that doesn't make a fun game.
If You Want To Be Nervous Buy The Game xDI'm Telling EveryoneIts best way for the play Don't Forget Only Play For Have Fun
this is the best game on whole universe.............................................first day i got chase by kid with rifle crazy day
I played mine for a couple months and then it updated the other day and now it will not let me play anymore.
With all the hackers and cheaters on line this is a singleplayer game thus not worth the full price.Game is great graphics worlds very detailed and amazing but without decent mp it gets boring very quick.Don't bother playing it online unless you feel like dealing with mostly invincible cheaters or meteors hitting your cars as the game is overun with cheaters. So be prepared for a repetetive simple SP game that takes place in a great looking world. and for those who say hey just play with your freinds well some dont like waiting around all day for when a couple people on your freinds list are online to go fight ai. It is like a IP LAN only game then which is not always the most exciting thing to wait around to play.If they were able to get rid of most of the hackers i would give it a thumbs up. Either that or add a billion things to SP to make it interesting one or the other. As it is now though this game has no replay value
This game is brutal. Great ffa
the best ) and the worst
Has a long way to go. But will be a good game one day
Amazing game. Really good I highly recommend. Countless things to fight never gets boring.
Unacceptable performance even for a early access game.Barely 60 FPS with everything low on a GTX 1080.Servers lag stutter and rubberband like they are being hosted on a potato powered calculator.
Can shoot random people. Die and do it again. 10/10 would recommend
Steaming pile of garbadge where veteran players are placed into the same games as newbies. Horribly optimalized a joke of a tutorial and the only way to play with 1 or 2 friends is to always be survivors. Also there are only ranked modes with the exclusion of being able to play with a group of 5
Good game
I hate everybody that plays this game...
Great game!Fast furious &amp easy to get into with lots of options to customize your cars with.It's a fun game that all friends can get into and have a few laughs with without having to pour hours of your time into it.If you like car games and or football you NEED to get this game.
"""Servers are busy try again later"" that."
Load Simulator that keeps taking your money.
H1Z1 feels like a kids game after playing this game. By far the best battle royale game out there.
single player is amazing it has a great storyline and separate individual tasks to complete which keeps it interesting depending on how long you spend on the game it should take you under a month to complete it all.Multiplayer is pay to win if you want all of the best apartments offices cars etc. and don't want to spend time being a ceo you will more than likely be buying shark cards. I've not had much problems with the online community because there are ways to get into online sessions alone if you do your research. If you do run into hackers or people trolling LEAVE the game simple. Overall its an amazing game and 100% worth the money you pay for it the only let down is the online community.
I expected alot more from Grand Theft Auto V for PC ...I have played this game on a console and was one the best games I played for it so far but I really can't say the same about the PC version ...Firstly my game is having issues with rendering the textures so it makes it impossible to drive .Also I could see the game is a lot more confusing ...I'M ASKING FOR A REFUND !!
Runs as smooth as butter on my GTX 570 even on high graphics. Still looks better than PS4 even though my machine is not a beast.
seryously the game is full of cheaters and most of em are from china grate game in all the other aspects but until is cheater free its almost unplayeable
BANNING PEOPLE FOR HARRASING STREAMERS
This game is cheap af and I have been playing it longer than every 60 dollar game I have ever bought combined just about. it is awesome and never stops being awesome. much luv bruv mwah
Product received for free. Nice game
Best soccer game. Better graphics than FIFA (and more fun too). Great with friends if you have internet.
Awesome game wish they had more of the Deluxe key though didn't find out about this game until after it was all sold out.
This is too expensive... .
this game develops cancer cells in me
Fun and addictive. Worth the money.
campanha só joguei no xbox e no ps4Online 8/10 loko é pouco
helk kinda sucks tho i miss gary
good game lots of fun even when you're killed by bs
This game is absolute time consuming i love it!!
"Although the game is fun this fact is overshadowed by the AWFUL match making and multiplayer connection issues. The first time I played I went up against ""Semi Pro"" players and got dumpstered. The fact that the game puts me up against people with hours in the game when i just started leaves a bad taste in my mouth.*Edit* Anyone who is thinking about buying the people that say the reviews are unhelpful just say so because they are biased about the game do not purchase until match making and server connection issues are fixed."
Dont buy this Take two interactive is screwing it over with the online gameplay and anti modding policys.

"Five minutes into my first playthough I was amazed. I started off naked with a rock and torch and began exploring the world. Before I knew it I was making friends. Two men geared up with ak 47's told me to get on my knees. As one pointed the gun at me the other pretended to have forceful sexual acts on me while screaming ""squeel like a pigg weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"". After they 15 minutes they finished . I was shot in the in the head and robbed.11/10 IGN ""WOULD PLAY AGAIN"""
Fortnite but wayyyyyyyy worse. ) Not worth buying at the moment maybe when they stop worrying about Fortnite.
great game
I used to like this game until I had to start re verifying the game files just to get it too work. was 10/10 now its a broken mess. I know it's not just meeither I've found many posts with similar problems. fix ur or you will lose more than just me as a player which you already have.
The game itself is good but Rockstar just keeps on pumping out new DLCs to earn money but give no support to the actual game. The lobby is extremely buggy and the amount of hackers is astonishing. Would NOT recommend.
very sucky grapics when played on a Mac couldn't do much with the game and i didn't have it for long so I asked for a refund and could not get one... This game is NOT worth the money sorry
Buy it for skyrim together
If you like the servers from EA go play this game. If you like to constantly hit the post go play this game.
"This game is a good game its just Take Two that have made this review a negative one. Take Two have sent a cease and desist to the biggest mod for all GTA games just so they can profit from the multiplayer. To quote NerdCubed ""I'm sorry you only have billions instead of trillions"""
Review Rocket League isn't the traditional game. You think its something to do with well rockets however... Really football with RC cars which have boots. Even if your not a fan of football its still a great game. Definitely a fun and hetic game. To add you can also make other cats explode on contact if you have enough speed. Overall Verdict Graphics 8/10Gameplay 8.5/10Variety 4/10 (No new content) Final Verdict This is a game which should be in everyones Steam libary even if not for a serious game just to relax or a bit of quick fun.
great game definately get your moneys worth.
LOVE IT

people ruin your home while you aren't playing
It feels kinda unfair to thumbs down since my problem is not the game itself and I'm having a lot of fun but unless the optimization gets better and I can hunt with others and not disconnect 3 minutes after joining a hunt I really can't thumbs it up.
Wow I have never played a optimized game on launch like this thank you rockstar for restoring faith in the pc community
It's pretty good.
it dusnt work
"Rust is a tough game to get into. Very fun when you do. Altough early access the game comes filled with to do. Doesn't feel empty like most other ""EA"" games. That added with the massive amounts of updates weekly and on time most of the time this game had and has tons of more potential ! Great game to play with friends. Prepare to lose and have to restart."
390 hours in and still trying to learn new moves.Easy game to pickup extremely hard to master.Fun for all agesCan't recomend this game enough.Tons of fun
China #1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Balanced and addictive multiplayer it's fun to play as the monster and survivor! Bravo

Long grinding start and a swift of an arrow the battle begins
/// Barely 65 FPS (with 4 players) with a GTX 1070 and a I5 7600K ///I have been a fan of Monster Hunter since it release on PSP. MHW does a great job at introducing you at new features amazing maps and great looking new monsters however it's hard to reccomend. I did the math and 12 out of 25 online quest I would get DC/ed and that's not fair. I am aware that you can rejoin a session after you DC/ed but still would bug you and won't allow you to join again after two times. It is extremely frutrating being disconnected from a Story Quest if you try to rush the story mode you will be undergeared and it is extremely hard to make good gear against strong monsters when you keep getting disconnected and are undergeared. Plus the fact that when someone joins the mission the difficulty gets adjusted to the number of players (the monster gets a Maximum HP increase) and then you will have to solo than monster after being disconnected with a really high HP. My solution was to brute force the arena quest (short quests in an attempt to finish the quest ASAP before getting disconnected) then soloing all my Story Quest after making gear. If you solo you would easily take 30 minutes or more vs a monster if you go with 4 people it would take around 15 minutes. Kinda regret playing the game the disconnected issue hinders this game too much.
Keeps getting better.
Switching to Fortnite cant stand updating my game every week for no results. You should focus more on making the servers run smooth rather than trying to add more to the game. Love the game but im just sick of 1 out of every 15 games is playable and the rest are laggy or you disconnect for no reason.
Hours and hours and hooooouuuurrrrss of fun excitement anger rage depression hope fun excitement and so much more. Get this game!
it was fun to play. I feel bad about unistalling it (
I originally couldn't play due to bugs and crashing and started with a negative review that I said I would update once it would play consistently enough. At first it was the refresh rate setting in game causing constant crashes. Since I have a 120 hz monitor i set it to that in game but it kept crashing. When I tried leaving it at 60hz or 99 hz the inital crashing stopped. Then i started getting intermittent ERR_GFX_D3D_INIT crashes to desktop sometimes combined with nvlddmkm error telling me to reboot or reinstall the game every 10 minutes to 2 hours. Also I was seeing a lot of screen tearing with or without v sync no difference. After looking around for troubleshooting advice I found a solution that worked for me here https //www.youtube.com/watch?v TjEQmZrRmtEIt turns out that some cards' max boost clocks don't match the standard boost value being reported. Since I adjusted the values low enough I've been playing crash free for 15 hours or so.Now that I have been able to enjoy the game a bit it's turning out to be a real work of gaming art. Plenty of memes humor subtlety action variety graphics and so on. Can't wait to see how it develops.
Been playing this game for a good few years now and I'm still not tired of it!Can't recommend this one enough.
best game to play with friends or solo

Its a fun game
Yes
I own H1Z1 i own the culling... i tried many different BR games but this still remains the best there is right now IMHO! The game has it's flaws like the vehicles physics game optimization that goes heavy even on my high end pc people from other servers zones that come in the europe one and lag... People complain about this and that but they don't know what it's been on H1Z1 (no updates laggy servers nothing new till they realized they were losing players) and that the game is been out for about 5 months and they made more foward leaps than any other early access i own that were out there for years! come on guys don't be just cause you have problems we all have the same issues in the game but we aren't y like you (oh and chinese fellows it's not our fault your socialist goverment censors your internet so get a grip and stay out of our servers)05/06/2018 fix the cheater problems and you're good to go24/12/2018 the games runs really good (some frame drops here on there but on ultra settings) and the content is really good! 4 maps new weapons and you get in game drops if you level up! i'm really happy they got it back together and that there aren't so many cheaters as before
What was H1Z1 again? I cannot even remember anymore.
Decent game
I really like the gameplay but I really hate the lobby system!! There is no effing excuse to have to wait 60 seconds from when the fourth suvivor joins to when the matchs loads. The timer reaches ten seconds then boom someone leaves! The option to start match when there is only one survivior should have been added! Plus the is the fact this game eats RAM. It was running at 4.5GB when I ran it for an hour! I cannot recommend this game til the Devs fix some of the issues with it!!
The whole anti modding thing really put a sour taste in my mouth. It's basically the only reason to keep playing for me anyways.

It's a super fun game.LOVE IT !!
Hello Take Two I know that rockstar doesnt want modding to be banned because at the start they where supporting it. But because there is money involved thing change radicaly. When banning modding you take away the fun you can have with non vanilla software. By doing this you are forcing your buyers (players) to play what you have created. If you are paying money for something you should have the right to alter it in a little way. Its the same with cars you buy a car and may change the color of it as many times as you want or even upgrade it without buying a new one. I tink you should revise your choice of banning modding and making it undone.TheDutchGoat
It's a pretty fun game. pew pew bang bang chicken fun
Rust is a truly fantastic game but it is utterly ruined by the horrible racist sexist degenerates that play this game. If they would have spent 10% of their dev time on how to ensure this group of people don't ruin the game for everyone else this truly would have been spectacular
Product received for free. great game if you love to farm like crazy
really good game. story mode has great narrative and characters and online is fun(ish).only problem is that this makes my laptop hotter than the core of the ing sun
Cant kick someone out of the party10/10
Overally the game is very good. Graphics are nice and gameplay is interesting. Variety of survivors killers perks offerings items and add ons gives you other tactics and changes the whole gameplay. Thanks to that Dead by Daylight is still fun even after playing for 100+ hours. The one thing that might be irritating is people some killers just camp near a hooked survivor making it impossible to save him. I know that's a part of the game but it can sometimes stop you from making a daily ritual especially when your playing as a character you don't main.
fun game overall 3 times more interesting then white noise thats for sure. Just make sure you dont get hooked! hahaha
I liked it.
Good game!1337

Very nice story &lt 3 loved playing it for the first time. got really into the missions and had good time. multyplayer little bit different but nice anyways D

Drecks spiel. Performance ist im Keller Gegner killen dich durch dir Wand Gebäude laden nicht du schießt in Steine obwohl du scopen kannst Schüsse verschwinden in der Luft etc.... die Liste geht ewig weiter. Dieses Spiel ist nicht fertig man hätte mit dem Early Access warten sollen und einen wirklich stablien Build porgammieren bevor man überhaupt überlegt hat das Spiel auf den Markt zu klatschen.Es hat Hype ja. Aber Hype ist nicht gleich gutes Spiel z.B. CoD. Scheiß game riesen Hype um jeden Ableger. Und jetzt will Bule Hole noch mehr neue Features einbauen... Vllt sollte man erst das fixen was vorhanden ist und nicht gleich sowas brachiales wie Game Testing überspringen.Nicht kaufen nicht bevor es aus dem Early access ist.GGRageMe
Rust...what can i say about a fun enjoyable game like rust.let's see...oh COMPLETLY AWSOMEyou spawn with a rock 2 bandages and a torch your only goal is to survive.i only got the game because my friend said it was fun i realy didnt enjoy but thats because i didnt understand itthis game is so amazing when my friend finaly got on our big trouble was trying to find eachother but we finaly did we did so many amazing things we decided to hide in the mountain's since its more peacefule there untill we could get a gun we noticed that there are these rad zones filled with radiation if your rads go over 500 your dead but the rad areas are full of research kits if you cant craft something you can use these research kits so when you die you can craft it again but me and my friend (jeseipi) decided to wait untill were more radiation resistant come to find out we find this guy's house full of epic loot he had a 9mm pistol along with 9mm ammo i took that when i saw it and found these things called rad pills that take off radiation so after i gathered those i thought we should set camp for the night it began as two little shaks and a campfire outside the a little later after gathering enough materials we had a little tiny fort then we set up this thing called a foundatio wich was wood block used for walls or something so after a little bit more we had this room that noone could raid unless they had c4's (very rare in the game) then i decided to finaly use the rad pill's and go get some epic loot i heard about in the rad zones i brought my gun with me because there are radiated animals and are deadly so after picking off the animals i entered the zone and found lots of things like research kits and rad armor while jeseipi was gathering resources i thought while he gather's resources ill just help us advance in technology and we got to the point where jeseipi had made us this nice sized fort and i had gotten us from 1 pistol to m4's and silencer's so we decided to go to the rad zone together (we had gathered alot more rad pills) and we would work on getting research kits so we can learn how to craft things we dont know how to craft (when you start you can craft the basic stuff under the crafting list you use this research kit to add to the list so you can craft it) and then we had to go for the day so when i got back on i found that a noob had taken his time to break one of my walls and steal all of my things this included m4 two 9mm pistol's and three p250's all my good armor and bunches of important mateial's. so that leaves with me having to recraft everything i did eventualy gt everything (jeseipi was offline and i decided to check on our base while he was away and when you disconnect your character's body will lay there till you log on again leaving you 100% vulnerable unless ur behind a metal door) and the rest of the story will continue tommorow 5/11/2014 at 5 00pm.i highly recommend this game it is extremly fun everyone needs to know this game it is so realistic as well i love the ambience as well there are even Some servers where people have built large villages me and jeseipi went on an empty server so we wouldnt get raided right away.
It is better then DayZ could be pretty special with a few updates. After playing a good amount of hours now with friends and then taking a very long break I am amending this review slightly. I will say that the game was a blast for awhile but due to the limitations of what has been provided by the developers thus far the fun runs out pretty fast for my group of friends and I. I am keeping the game installed and updated awaiting the big changes when they release the new version. The game is still very promising and I would still recommend it to anyone who enjoys survival first person games.
Amazing
Trailer looks bad but when u start your first game you running like a headless chicken thats some casual walking in that trailer xD
nice game
it's good but hoops is better
bazelgeuse.....Seriously though nerf his encounter rate......rest is great and all the minor flaws can be explain that it is a new generation monster hunter game that can't just straight up reuse old asset.

Perfect Hacking Simulator Game CHEATERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUND
"i bought this game for modding.modding gta is now ""illegal""..."
UPDATE The game is still very buggy the lag is still present but at times worse as the server cant even keep 10 people on one server from having severe lag constantly then you have these idiots that go around and put pillars everywhere so that no one can find a spot to build the devs need to address this issue quickly the dinos arent running through my house anymore yet you start as a lvl 1 and will have lvl 116 birds come from the sky and attack up non stop at the early stages this being said the devs still have yet to address real issues they feel its more important to keep pushing out new content while they are turning a blind eye to the acts people are using to grief others to the point they cant even play the game also when they do updates that dont require client restarts if your on your flying mount you are automatically dismounted in air to fall to your death then you cant find your mounts anymore also in my case my first week back to try the game yet again i had to relocate my base 3 times because the devs kept changing the boundary lines for the updates they put out so in a short if you like the devs ing you up or like being griefed by other players in PVE not just PVP then this game is the bucket of youve been waiting for.Still would not recommend this to anyone at the current point In the games current state I would suggest that you hold off on your purchase of said product. The game is fun when playable. However there are alot of server issues with the game in its current state where the lag spikes can get you killed in more ways then one for example i was swimming the server hit a huge lag spike my character then was dead by the time the lag subsided from drowning another time i was out harvesting items to build my house when yet another lag spike reared up and i was attacking my a group of raptors and by time the spike went away yet again i was dead.Other game breaking issues that still havent been fix are the fact the dinos can kill you through walls inside your house when your not there then when you log in your house is not destroyed but youve been killed in my case this has happened 3 different times on one very fustrating occasion i logged in to being killed and having all of my items missing from my house even though my house was still intact so i was apparently killed through walls and the dinos destroyed all the items in my house not anyone else as this was a PVE server and not a PVP server. And today i logged into having been killed again by dinos but to top it off my home was filled with rocks to the point I couldnt enter or exit or get to my chests to create a item with which to break them with. Im tired of seeing these developers adding in new content while failing to prioritize the game killing bugs like the ones mentioned above. these devs are not addressing any of the major issues instead they keep pouring in more and more content ( which is good for a finished product) but in this case they are not holding themselves up to a level of detail that I myself would claim to be professional the content adding should be halted until they have the major issues fixed.If you dont care about losing hours of work or dying in your home from dinos that seem to be like casper the ghost and your not easily fustrated at things like that then this game maybe fun for you if your like me who has PTSD and gets upset because your dying from random things like server lag and dinos that go through walls then i suggest you save you money and spend it else where on a finished product that has good reviews.this game has good reviews but to many are fan boys who adobt games early and can find no flaws or just dont care that there money is spent on good quality products so as of now i cannot recommend this game knowning that is has major issues that alot of people are not addressing.

Removed my positive review
"I was just reading some of the reviews for the game. front page reviews were all negative just because rockstar avoided reducing the price during summer sale by throwing in Multiplayer money. They need to review the game for what it actually is not because of what could be considered a ""bad buisness practice"" (most $60 dont even go on sale anyways so dont blame rockstar for taking the same road and trying to throw in extra in game money). The game itself is great. i dont want to go into an in depth review but i would suggest watching the angry joe review or a credible reviewer give their take not some random plebs who dont even talk about how the game actually playes."
Super fun have a balst playing it most of the time playing with friends is HILARIOUS and modding Bae. Only complaint is LAG I have become the laughing stock of the game by missing ridiculously easy hoals because I lagged and missed a ball like 5 feet in front of the goal. I know it sounds like I don't like the game but it really is fun just make sure you have a good computer _
the Best online game i ever played i recommend everyone to buy this game you wont regret
Nice game i love it...
Ye Boi
Very Noice
When u get ING HACKED AND UR ITEMS ARE DELETED ALL YOURE GETTING FROM THE ING SUPPORT M8 UR ITEMS BUT THANKS FOR THE BUCKS BUT WHEN WE CAN HELP YOU OTHERWISE PLS TELL US
this game is so fun
The Game graphic not optimised lotsa hacker after every single update. Not worth buying.
RIP OpenIV.Go to hell Take Two and Rockstar.
Devs doing nothing about hackers don't waste your money
The Linux version hasn't been working properly for months. It crashes 2/3 times when loading a new match.Edit It seems it was caused by corrupt game files... Doh.
A+ game D physics
Product received for free. i have been playing for about 3 months i already have 380 hours on it.defenetly the right game when you wanna play a game with friends
good game
If you havent played this game yet... then something is wrong with you!Buy it!!! NOW!!!
Well the game looks a bit nice for an alpha but needs a lot of improvement. Well for start decrease lag. Ihave an exelent pc but getting tons of lag. putting down graphics is an option but makes the gme look ugly. Also we need way more guns such as sniper rifles. Anther thing is one shot to the head with anyhing to anyting moving such as players and zombies would be nice. Veicles would also be good because geting arround the map is very hard. (no homo). last thing we need more loot to find its very hard to get stuff for now. tnx (just one problem there is nothing more heartless and murderous than most of rust's player. no teaming at all they see you they WILL KILL.
pls like. tnx
I got banned from Rust 351 days ago! I was playing for the first time on my new computer because I was excited so I joined an offical server. I was just playing around for a little bit becuase I had no idea what to do. So then I was wondering and found a pile of keys on the ground so I picked them all up and tried every key locked base I could find. Then I found the one with the right key! So I opend it and found 3 Sleepers and I killed them all and took there stuff. Then I made my base and logged off. Wasent a good base but good for the night. So I went to bed IRL. Woke up excited to play Rust. Boom banned and could not join any server at all. So i spent 40$ for get banned after 20 hours! Why would I cheat. Then I put in many reports from Email. Non of them even got opend I got no responce nothing!!! So I decided to finally put it somewhere that they may actually look at it. If they were duped keys why would I get banned for it. Why not the dupper!! But I really enjoyed the game until I got banned!
Best game ever!!!!!!I recomend it to anyone who likes Sourvival and Rolplay GamesThe Game looks absolutly beautifull ( in fantastik setting ) and feels so real!The Devs are very active and support the community with many good updates and features!I m having very much fun playing this game!!PS The Trailer is very old tho dont let it scare you away from the game )
1 cheater in 180h....so calm your pants down
Meh.
really sucks stupid s running around modding.
Good
Really fun game to play with friends. When I bought it a year ago I didn't play it much. I had 10 hours in a year on the game. But now I have 110 hours in a month. Then I didn't play it with friends and now it's really fun with them. Sometimes there's toxic community but not that much. U can meet there a lot of new friends if u have not got any to play with.
((Updated))They're working on bringing back OpenIV stop giving good games a bad rep (I've even seen this on Kerbal Space Program). Leaving a bunch of bad reviews wont do all. Especially when you do it on games that have nothing to do with GTA 5. Grow up. The singleplayer is good multiplayer is a bit grindy but with a couple heists you can get most of the stuff unlocked (content wise like CEO/Biker stuff). Not going to give everyone a bad name but there are alot of people leaving bad reviews just because they can't use OpenIV to cheat in multiplayer anymore. Those that are doing it because of singleplayer mods I get it. But at least keep your ing and moaning to the game in question. Spreading it to games that Take Two has even barely breathed on (KSP for example) is hurting nobody but those developers. TL DR ignore the negative reviews about OpenIV but dont buy it unless it's 50% off or better.

Best game played so far at the battle royal category so much bugs but still the best cant wait until its coming out fully !!

This is very cool game i love it !
Product received for free. I LIKE THIS GAME A LOT!!!!!!
If you wish to play GTA V OnlineConsider this takes 3 5 min to access online session also if you join a mission from msg on mobile. it brings you to loading screen and if the room is full. you wait for loading screen again to be summoned in the city when you start heist if someone leaves the room that mission is aborted if someone dies during heist(Hard) you have to replay it again and some mission save point is useless. There are bad players like Chinese who sings all the time in the session psycho High LV players who kill you hackers(not found recently)Anyway all missions are fun. if you play with your friends I definitely recommend
The game itself is doing well but the optimization problem is always difficult to solve the server processing power is too weak often crash playing an hour game will be connected half an hour server really very frustrating.
Amazing game worth every penney
THIS IS THE MOST JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ GAME.....
Changed my mind the game is Getting ier
"One of the best open world/action/online games. Really loved it can't wait for more uptades!EDIT OK I think that I can properly judge the online part of the game as I have over 650 hours. Every dlc is EXACTLY the same. The olny difference is that with every dlc you have to pay more real life money to be able to get the full experience. I mean ok I understand that they somehow must make money bit I believe that if those dlc were not free both the community and the items would be better. With every dlc they add new weapons (personally i dont know anyone who uses more than 2 rifles the heavy sniper the RPG and the AP pistol) new vehicles (and because it is GTA all vehicles are similar) with customization that costs an extraordinary amount and the same jobs re made with another name and different vehicles. Ok R* you want money but I do not want to play a repetitive game hours of grinding just to buy a car and almost impossible to play the game alone.At this point I actually do not know how to rate the game so I will leave the ""thumbs up"" but I am not sure if this game is worth the amount you will pay.2015 10/102017 6/10"
great fun !!

VERY GOOD PLAY DIS GAME
Great by itself better with at least one friend. Combat is simple but nuanced and the variety of monsters and missions keep things fresh.By far however my favorite part of this game is the gorgeous environments. I'm a sucker for great scenery.
Uhh yeah this game owns.
4/10 bad optimization bad servers

This game is ing peace of because the game have Battle Eye Launcher and Battle eye launcher is bugged and glitched.
This is an example of a good game that doesn't cost $60. This game is extremely challenging and a blast to play with friends!
The most incredible pre alpha sandbox game ever hopefully the simplicity of the play remains the same as it advances into more content.
Product received for free. DON T BUY THIS STUPID GAME IS FULL OF STUPID PEOPLE WITH COBWEB WI FI AND U ARE GONNA RUIN YOUR WHOLE DAY PLAYING THIS GAME BY PLAYING WITH LAGGING KILLERS YOU
Easily the best early access game out of the countless early access games I have played. The devs listen to the community and are regularly updating the game with fixes and some new content.
i cant play the game sense it tells me rocket league servers are offline and i it like 10 times ad still doesnt work
i like this game but there is a lot wrong with it.
I love this game is very goodddd
5 star .
Good game
I've been anticipated for this game since the first trailer came out. I was sad when it didn't come to PC at first but when it did boy was I hyped. The gameplay is great the graphics are great the story is great and the online mode (even though there are quite some hackers) is marvelous as well. I could do nothing but praise this game!
I love this game with a passion everything from farming trees and stone to make guns to running around with your mates killing everyone you pass. Best game of 2016
Having fun building a base and thinking that this game will be fun. Hackers completely destroy our base can see what we have where we are and build through our base like its nothing. Great game completely ruined by hackers.
Autumn up messed this game up uninstalling..
Their is many things wrong about this game. One building is if you want to destroy a wall its essintially impossible and if you misplace an object oh well that object is gone. If you lost your keys from someone and you are trapped in your house with no resources welp you just have to break a wall to get out. Also the community is . I was about done with this game so i decided how about i give my house to someone if they did not kill me but no they just would rather kill someone who has nothing than go to a house with guns turrents chests full of loot and food. Also if you want to make a team that probably wont happen because 99% of the people their would kill you immediatly even if you have no loot at all. Its more of a deathmatch than a survival game. Also this game has been out for five ing years and its still alpha wtf. Oh and also if you dont want to play a deathmatch game and play a singleplayer rust well basically thats since the only enemys are bears and wolves which dont really harm you if you have a sleeping bag nearby. This game would be so good if people dont try to instantly kill you everytime you see them. When I play a survival game I want a game were people try to make friends and work together not just player on their computer killing eachother for absolutly no reason. Overall the game is great without the people and the building part but since the game is basically a multiplayer game its because of the community.
I was and everyone would play like a man in the top 10 where as now i'm good everyone hides in the grass and sit's in corners like 3 year olds
fun game but can be annoying lol
Love the game play it to much.
Intoxicated servers always either down or not up to date. Really disappointed ) good game. but not for South african peeps. Awesome when you want to show your friends a broken game D
OpenIV
this game sucks so much it has so many bugs and no one is trying to fix them
Awesome Game!
Hunger games on speed..... like a drug im hooked on this game was my first impressions before full release of the game but now I have to disagree now. Hackers plague the game and the lack of progression the dev have made will eventual be the death of PUBG. And to bring out DLC for a uncomplete experience seems like a shot in the foot for Bluehole and has made so off with the whole game!
Crap optimization downgraded graphics to maximum possible game looks like minecraft still getting 7 8 fps on beefy computer. Extremely buggy crash on every 5 10 minutes. Probably refund it soon. DO NOT BUY IT!
Worst game you will ever play when the servers aren't crashing and you are losing all your progress for that game the game will bug and leave you without a HUD worst game to play competitively if at all. i would rate it 1/10 it is just all round terrible and all they want is your money
bad optimized
"This game is still early access if you want to play a crisp finished game then look elsewhere. If you're looking to have some fun with friends this game is perfect. Below are my good points and bad points Pros Great game with friends squads and duos focus heavily around team play and communicationAddictive gameplay no two games in a row will be the same due to RNGHeart pumping action certain moments will get the blood flowing!No ""pay to win""All players are essentially on a level playing field separated by luck and skill alone.The game can be played how YOU want to play it. Spawn into a busy area and kill as many people as possible in a short space of time OR spawn in a quiet area get lots of loot and try and kill mid to late gameCons No tutorial this game will throw you in at the deep end. Some patience is needed to begin with. Don't expect to spawn as a godCommunity can be either hilarious or highly offensiveAlthough only playing for a short time there has been downtime to servers minimal thoughHigh skill cap at times if you don't enjoy losing sometimes... don't buy the game!Graphics not optimisedAll in all I really enjoy this game so far and I'm sure with the coming updates that get added regularly it will only improve. The communities suggestions will be listened to and acted upon. This game will not be for everyone but I hope this review has been helpful."
nice game to waste time on
This game is bad but only if your with friends.I personally play on modded servers as they are more fun and easier to get started so don't read this if you want to play hardcore.This game will be really cool in the future at the moment it is still in really early production and is showing signs of being the best survival game ever made it combines all elements of wasteland style survival with a perfect physics based base design system.The only downside I see is the guns the game needs them but there are too many in circulation it would be better if you couldn't craft them but only find them.There are so may pros and cons in this game it would be impossible to name them all but I would definetly pick this up if you want a good survival game! 8/10
Great game and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
community
how the hell do i refund it it crashes too much
Better then Dayz. But i hate the research system with a fiery passion... My luck is so bad!!!
This game is not worth your time our your money.
핵 존나많음 카카오하셈this game has broken by hack
nice gameplay.. easy to play..
Awesome game for everybady!!! D
Short version lots of potential but fun so far about 10 houres of play to feel like you have done everything.if you like minecraft and wanted no mans sky to be good this game is for youLong version its in alpha give it some credit for already being better than no mans sky. if you really dont like it when a game has bugs then just wait a while instead of buying it now. it took me about 6 7 houres to understand the game fully (and discover some really annoying bugs). it looks nice untill you start to have a big base then it might get framey but it does look awesome with all the sun glare and dust and stuff.
Great fun and always runs well. Definitely a good way to pass time quickly and a good challenge when you get better
Stay away until the devs do something about the cheaters there are way too many of them and the devs are doing nothing. Esp aimbot and no recoil hacks like crazy just about every game.
p
Good game but lots of hackers.
hot gababbage
Epic simply epic there's nothing else I can say.
I'm just a bush I'm just a bush you did not see me. *Heartbeat Intensifies*
As a veteran and an owner of MHW on PS4 I definitely recommend this game. However several network issues can be a deal breaker for beginners.
Product received for free. no rules! just build base and kill someone! 10/10
Playerunknown campinggrounds
Product received for free. after playing this game for almost 100 hours i can say with 100% certany that this is one of the best games ive played. BUT if your the type of person to get mad easy then it probably isint for you
very addictive.
Great game to play with friends Few things still need work but seems like it is close to release now. Never had any crashes however the game does lag on the start up menu (which seems like it crashes) however if you leave it it will open just fine. Also isnt really the best optimised with my 970 I struggle to keep 60fps on med high settings at 1080p However this seems to be something in common with alot of similar survival games such as ARK.Overall I think this is a great buy at 15 even better if you get it on sale for around 10. I've played it more than most AAA games I have.
BEAUTIFUL
The game is good but it needs time to work out the bugs. Also the game is alot harder if you do not have good perks.Update It has gotten better
I dont know about this game anymore Its just so Un balanced i wish the devs would like Listen to there community more there always buffing killers and nerfing survivors they just make the game so dumb in a way of words i dont know what to say i would wait to get this game unless you have extra cash you just wanna spend.Well many updates later and here i am still playing this cancer filled game.UPDATE* This game actully sucks now pallets arent good killers cheat with wall hacks and theres a simple thing you change in the code as killer to have speed hacks like wtf this game it just sucks so much
400+ hours and confident the game will be improved. 26.99 has been great value for me.
i have had this game for about 2 and half weeeks now an have been playing alot despite this i have been having a really terrible experience. its really just one theing that destroys the gamplay and really brung me to unrecomending the game and thats the graphics issue. i have a gtx 965 and an i7 6700hq but even on VERY LOW settings i still only get 14 frames honestly its a cool game with alot of great things but its still has many bugs and the graphics issue really kills its almost unplayable
So I've played around 400hourish on this game mostly online. Loved the game even when there were crazy updates. I never cheated if i needed money I bought shark cards. I've been playing PUBG recently and I came to play GTA again for the first time in 4months. On the login screen it said Rockstar took 9mil from me. Seriously? Not going to play GTA for a long time
Great game
more bush
Quite possibly the best single player game I've ever played. Haven't tried GTA Online yet because I'm having a lot of fun doing Story Mode.
Lots of hackers recently mostly aim bot and increased speed. Don't buy this game until hey crack down on them.
Awesome game so much fun! D
Pro'sEasy to get intoNice ranking system5 min. matches so no need to jump in matches that take for ever.Con'sSome teammates aren't that nice
Really enjoyed the game for about a year then it became the same thing over and over but with new installments to the game it has brought back life to a dying community.
Nah don't play it don't pay for it. ?Just don't deal with it.
YOU CAN RAGE AT THIS GAME !!!
very good game
Dear Mr. player unkown Why do you insist on my wallet with this key system you have implented into this fine establishment. Why can't the crates be opened for free like in the beginning??? You've already made some good moneysss. You've made me steal my mom's credit card numerous times just to open the crates i've earned through countless hours of playing. I've had to leave my estate and move into a tent where all i eat is refried beans. Plz fix dis game.Sincerely Mr. Busa
It's a great soccer game with an even better developer that actually cares about its community.
Best Game i've ever Play
EDIT post mod fiasco Since Take Two has been willing to back down on their militant stance on mods for now I'm changing my recommendation back to a positive one as long as they remain as such. That being said I am still disappointed in their actions and the recommendation remains a tenative one even though the game is great. The original review will remain below for those who somehow ended up way down here Mods are easily half the fun of GTA while I honestly don't care about having paid mods killing the free modding scene for almost any reason makes me not recommend this product. Should this stance continue from the publisher/devs (or any others) I will never purchase another of their games.
I think we did a pretty good job so far
Product received for free. i love pubg speacially shroud his my no.1
this is awkward but i like to kill other players
an amazing game with only one problem THERE IS TOO MANY GOD DAM HACKERS
"SO i was playing squad with my friends. 20 mins in the game while looting and finding a good spot We've finally got up to the hill near the edge of the blue. Meanwhile. the kill charts keep appearing on the bottom left of the screen and the name ""GodisZcc"" keeps appearing showing that the player killed others with a headshot by M249. The name keeps showing up four to five times and it starts to get supsicious. After a while one of my teammate started to get aimed. Bullets started flying towards the player from an unknown spot. Not for long. my teammate and I got knocked out and killed. We checked the killer name and it was still that guy (GodisZcc). SO we stayed in the game (after we died) and checked those ""killed name chat"". The wall and aim hacker (GodisZcc) keeps dominating the remaining players until they get the top #1. I hopethese hackers will get banned in the sooner future so that the time and effort that we put in while gaming will not be wasted."
Really love it amazing world great single and multiplayer and of course the mods that can be downloaded on this game absolutely amazing.
great game
8/10Could've been a 9 without issues like bad optimization and some graphical bugs and overall the numerous connection issues which i hope will be fixed within the next weeks. In terms of gameplay and content it's a very good game.
Still great even while in development.
"I went into buying this game with high hopes.When I tried playing (Every Time) I was Murdered.Sure I'd kill a guy or 2 along the way but this is just another one of those ""If you know someone you're better off"" games.Groups of buddies with no lives rule almost every server on Rush.If you are a Solo Player Basically avoid this game unless you Really like restarting and causing minor mischief. I still recommend it though Despite it's many flaws and Still being ""Unfinished"" Annoyed my Amazing PC can only amp the graphics so much. Some video options for Ultra would be nice.I feel like it needs Shaders or something..."
NICE!
Alot of fun campaign mission this time around they focused on 3 characters and bank heists and some side missions. The online is fun once you get to the lvl 12 and heists but overall it wasnt as much fun as I was hoping it would be online.I'd grab it for half off or discounted if you are in the mood for big open world GTA gaming.
Good port that ran very smooth for me. 8/10
It is a fun game.
The game is decent overall but the loading times on GTA O make me want to claw my eyes out. also the frequency of modders and hackers on GTA Online shows how bad this game's anti cheat is.... Would recommend for storymode although GTA San Andreas has a far better story.
it fun if you are noob at this game you are going to get rekt.
Really really fun! Amazing Graphics!
i really like this game and beautiful graphic
Pretty good game one of my favourite.The developers should add more content especially new weapons and ways to feel the game more dynamic.GG
Product received for free. the best co op game !
one of the best games i have played and one of the gilchest like he said WE'VE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR.MEMESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
one of the greatest game ever and with mods it becomes something unbelievable
I have this game both here on PC and on PS4. Combined I have over 250 hours playing.This review won't be that long as there are only a few things I think are really pertinent to you purchasing/not purchasing this game.1) It's multiplayer. Playing with friends is more fun. If you like playing single player games don't get this. There are more fun multiplayer games to go at solo anyway.2) This game is fun. It's soccer with rocket boosted cars. I mean come on that's just fun.3) It's easy to jump in and play. If your gaming time is a little more limited and you want something you can play for 30 minutes this is a great game for that.4) If you tilt easily in multiplayer games then either don't buy this game or realize that you'll straight up need to stop playing for a bit when you start to get mad. I get mad sometimes when I go on a losing streak. When that happens stop for the day.
yes i only have 3 hours on record but after about 500 ps4 games i ran out of ps+ and thought ill get this its so much better more fps quality and better player base
10/10 Would spank blue pikachu again. (Networking sucks
Best/Funniest game to play with Friends. I recommend to buy it )
it's good
this game is very laggy and practically unplayable.
Don't buy take 2 have banned modding.
"Played for a bit and let me just say this game is really fun but increadibly frustrating. The skill checks are completely jarring the fact that you can't get off hooks or beartraps except to RNJesus is frustrating. The fact that it takes way to ing long to do a single generator is frustrating. The fact that the killer can treat you like and taunt you by not killing you instantly is frustrating. The lack of a tutorial is frustrating. The fact that you lose your items is frustrating. The fact that this game is getting mostly positive reviews is frustrating. WHAT WORKS The concept and feel of the game is quite on the mark. The dread you feel as the killer is hunting you/looking for you is incredibly addicting and has a great feel.WHAT DOESN'TAnything I listed above that was ""frustrating""."
Good Game )
bad matchmaking.if you're unranked you play against pros only.good developement.
Good Really fun to play with friends. The game is huge. Love how the game is constantly updated with new things.Bad Hackers are abundant and relentless. Most of the online community is aggressive for no reason. The loading times are super long but understandable (use an SSD if it bothers you too much).EDIT Forgot to add that the game goes into windowed mode every time I Alt+Tab.
BMX with a touch of FPS10/10
banned me for doing absolutely nothing. Thanks Rockstar.
can u fix the worst SEA Server?dont take a people money but you still running bad server
Crashy mess.
Cars. Football. 10/10
While the idea behind Rust is very good and very nice and worth the $20 the game itself comes nowhere close to that. Admittedly I just started playing a month ago or so but still. Maybe it was good back then but I can tell you it is not good now. Any of the servers that you are gonna get on you know as a starter (so the noob ones or beginner only ones) are all filled with dummies like you gettiing absolutely nothing done. The blind are just leading the blind to nowhere good. The best part about these servers are when you pick a fight against a dude with a rock while you have a spear. 10/10 gameplay. I know that there are many videos and documents that tell you how to play but not to seem like I'm a TL DR sort of guy it ruins the fun to study something just so that you can play it. If you want to just hop right in and have so much fun with the people in the newest server well then this game is not for you. While I am sure that many people will love this game if you want to jump right into a game don't want to be doing nothing the first hour or two want to not get pummeled by people most obviously better than you want to not get left behind by bozos that won't help you for the same reason you won't study the gameplay mechanics to the core so you can get anything or just want your computer to not take 10 years or so to get into one single server then this game just isn't for you. It's not for me and that's why it gets a bad review. (
the loading screen is my favourite part of this gameits also the only part...
The best hunting game i ever played
Rocket League is a game in which you get to learn rocket science with cars and a soccer ball.
NO MODS!!!! TAKE TWO YOU DONE F***ED IT UP!!!!!!
Servers can be a little laggy but should be fixed soon. Best Battle Royale game out right now.
Very Fun game especially with mods !
br&gt
Edit Last year PUBG was good. This year i beg to differ. The game has been plagued with micro transactions loot boxes and with a dwindling playerbase you would'nt expect these from the devs.Mass bannings have been a thing since its release what makes it worse they do not respond to complaints or listen to the community in general.This game was good now its not.What else did I expect A very unsatisfied customer.
trash
Love this game loose many hours playing this with my best friends highly recommend. Very addictive you have been warned.
Suck game's server ever.
got addicted during the free weekend now i cant stop playing REALLY FUN!
thanks for no fps lol
Good game. Better gunplay than Arma 3 mod by far. Games are quick so its not incredibly dismaying if you die early on. Wish customization was more implemented than it is i.e. gun skins vehicle skins maybe even tattoos. Still pretty fun its optimized like a better DayZ so its laggy even on a borderline supercomputer (1070 and 4690k 28gb RAM) but still playable (lowest I get on ultra is 30ish and 60 max as expected).
Most of the time the game doesn't even start the multiplayer game it gobbles up an enormous amount of RAM even though it is not a masterpiece of graphics. It is hardcore but the craft is boring and building is clunky. Maybe I've failed to understand the game but I can simply not recommend it.
An Amazing game for early access could use some fixing in the full game but its worth it for 36$ as it updates.
How a normal game goes...1. Spend 30 minutes collecting powerful gear and equiping my weapons with the best attachments2. Don't see another human soul for miles!3. Gets headshotted by some ding dong in his underwear who got a lucky shot from a f cking mile away4. Repeat for 40 hours cause your wife left you and you got nothing to live for.
After more than two years of devolopment You kill a deer you still get ******* raw chicken breast Best game EVER 10/ raw chicken breast
Fix your damn servers instead of adding pointless weapon skins...................................................................... otherwise dont pay them more money... wont even get you to the lobby for 30 minutes. Kicks you out of matches once if not twice everytime you play. The game had so much potential to be one of the best every but they can't get their straight to ever be reliable
huge spins and bad hitboxes
HACKERS ARE RUINING THE GAME NOT TO MENTION THE LANGUAGE BARRIER!
goodgood
best game evaaaaaaaaaanot recomended becuz garry said to tell him hes bad at his job garry you suxs I LOVE RUST EXPERIMENTALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
This game is so glitch. The online is so bad. Too much lagg on online. Rockstar support sucks.
Open world multiplayer at it's best
This is not a fun game. I suppose if you like constantly dying to some idiot camping in a room or getting sniped from a billion miles away it's a hoot but for people with any kind of self respect it's simply not a good game. It controls like a wet sponge sluggish and barely responsive. It's ugly as sin. I spend more time sitting in lobbies waiting for games to start than I do playing the actual game. I can't understand the hype around it. I guess it's like heroin. You watch helplessly as your loved ones get hooked and eventually you lose contact with them because the drug got 'em. PUBG is a drug. And not the fun kind.
"I've really enjoyed my first 10 hours on the game. t's definetly made for duo teams but works well in both solo and squad. Only minor bugs here and there mostly sound bugs but also a ""stuck in revival mode"" bug that can be pretty frustrating. I still recommend the game it's been an enjoyable stressful experience.TL DR Beat someone to death with a frying pan. 7/10"
Its pretty gud
Product received for free. This Is A Fun Multiplayer Game Where It Can Be Buggy But Its Still Fun And To Fix The Launch Error Just Update Your Windows.
will die alot
i dont like because we need to wait for server like 10 min or 15 and no worthit i hope for future to fix
Perfect game.When you play it with your friends is lot of fun.For me it was a fantastic game experience.But sometime it is lag as after update.And don't ask me what is better PUBG or Fortnite for me is PUBG but it is on your choice what is better for you.
Spend 3 hours getting materials to get rekt by some boy a rock.10/10 would play again
"I do not recommend this game to potential buyers. It has a very high skill cap for new players to learn the game to the point of many people not wanting to try it again because they get absolutely demolished by people abusing exploits to lower their ranks and somehow not getting banned for it.... Meaning people playing killer with 2200+ hr gameplay are getting put in the same match with 0 30 hour survivors. This is terrible design. It's also terrible that survivors are getting nerfed more and more. Less pallets bloodlust slower vault speeds games being extended longer by several minutes because of perk combinations like Ruin and BBQ Chili.... BBQ Chili even on Billy is the most anti fun game you can play. This game has gone from jump scare Michael games to annoying grind fests where you're held hostage in a round with a killer... e.g. a Doctor that you have to attempt to sneak around which is nearly impossible and also impossible to get away from Doctors or do any actions once they've chased you for a while. Ultimately the devs are making bad decisions by killing off interest for most of the player base the survivors. They're taking away bright/dark moonlight nerfing flashlights again reducing pallets more..... it's just way too much. The mechanic of simply ""running away"" is boring. Little strategy involved there. With devs talking about taking away moonlight already having nerfed mist to it not being worth playing etc... it sounds like they're trying to address the issue of people hacking items on their accounts in a less than productive way. I think there's a huge problem now that you have to rely more and more on terrible teammates to unhook you. This isn't scary it's annoying. Many of these changes just lead to frustrating game play. I'd say a reason many people still play is to unlock everything but even then it's not really great because devs are making games longer without actually giving us much more points.On the weekend that Freddy was released I got 3 5k tops most games. Normally with my full build I would get maybe 12 20k+. Doesn't matter if it's bonus points weekend if you still end up getting average points because you don't properly play test a killer and balance it.... you guys should seriously read the review bombs that happened around Halloween when Freddy came out. It was all deserved because little testing clearly went in to Freddy and it was nearly impossible to get away from him or do anything. Rare skillchecks to be found item add ons that were supposed to give you more skillchecks actually REDUCED your chance sabotage didn't cause you to wake up from his dream perma deerstalker on you etc.... just led to a very anti fun weekend. I should say it can be fun... especially if you group up with friends on voice chat but if new killers continue to end up being as unbalanced as Freddy and if devs continue to ruin their own game by keeping survivors hostage in garbage killer rounds then I cannot recommend this game anymore. Again the skill cap is already really high and these killer perks are punishing new players even more than previously... if you get demolished every time you play you might not want to play again. This has been the case for a number of my friends.****** TIPS FOR DEVS TO IMPROVE * Stop nerfing survivors. Removing items completely from the game (as well as pallets) is not a fix for balancing gameplay. It just makes the game more two dimensional and bland.* Survivors absolutely need ways to counter BBQ Chili more. Hiding in lockers should counter BBQ Chili. If a killer is BAD he should not be babysat by saying ""here are the survivors""... it takes away skill from the game.* Doctor is way too strong still. There should be a much longer window between screams when in stage 3 it's already way too easy for a doctor to hunt someone down even after they escape. If you ESCAPE from a killer by juking you should be able to get away for good. You shouldn't be punished for it. This is very bad design. You should not have to rely on selfish randoms to save you.* Consider adding a tutorial video or training mode for killers / survivors. The tips in the pre loading screen is a good start though"
Please fix this ing buggy hell hole of a game. Keep geting stuck to rocks. WTF.
"""NEW ANTI CHEAT SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED"" Cool maybe i'll get to play without cheaters now. logs in ""Account has been banned for hacking""Never cheated in my life. 200 hours in the game. Dont waste your money."
its alright
game so much potential but devs are legit garbage
"My grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate you have to stop immediately."". Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. Now I'm 24 and never touched a cigarette. I must say I feel a slight sense of regret for never having done it because the cheaters in this game gave me cancer anyway."
A simple concept executed flawlessly. Tons of hours of casual and competitive fun with friends and strangers over the internetSavage!
You can actually play actual soccer but you choose this. To play soccer with cars versus other cars. I did not regret buying this. 10/10
Im just joining the Down vote band wagonBut in all seriousness killing modding is kinda a low blow to your fans.
Honestly PUBG is fun but it is just too unoptimized to be released at this point. With the full 1.0 release expected to be mid december there is no way that it will be ready to go. Reguardless PUBG is a fun game to play with friends and I would recommend it if you want to sink hundreds of hours into a shooter.
i cant even play this game. it doesnt run on windows 7 apparently and ive tried the fixes. i really want to try it but sadly its gonna sit in my library until it works. if you are still running windows 7 (like any sane person should be) dont buy this game.
You can tell how good this game is by looking at the hours people have played it.
I r8 dis game cus dis game is rlly rad. U can go kill ppl and stuff and do heist and missions. Also da best part bout dis game is u can go to strip club. yeah a strip club not with an 's' cus der is only one strip club. sux
There are Free DLCs but you can't actually use them if you don't have ingame money. Funny how a frickin' car horn costs $75.000 and you earn a $20.000 from a heist setup. Heists are cancer with the online community anyways. Rockstar support doesn't give a rat's ... about you they just auto reply almost anything. This is actually much more evil then releasing a priced DLC. Not even gonna talk about OpenIV because that's a whole level of another story.
This game killed my free time P
Solid game 10/10 unless you dont like running around naked for most of the game and getting killed by korean trash talkers.P.S. This game has by far the most toxic community in any game even the entire xbox community is less toixc
One of the best game i've ever played. I've only played it as solo i even won once although i only played it for 10 hours (wow im a god o) but i think the best way to play it is playing as squad. You need friends to play with to experience the game 100% in a fun way. 9 out of 10 from me.
Good Games!
Trevor. Phillips.
why do we have to pay for more for dlc not to mention the total cost of DLC is way more than what you pay for the game by 50%. As if the game wasnt already pricy enough
Sure it's buggy. But I've been having more fun with this game than I have with any other in a long time.
The developer team is digging this game a bluehole to lay it to rest in. Rampant hackers and horrible game servers make playing horrible. Streamers of this game get stream sniped constantly with no action by Blueballs to prevent it. PUBG could have been a great game had the developers actually invested money into fixing the problems that exist instead of creating loot crates and new maps.
中国的服务器做得不好 还得花钱买加速器玩
The best game ever )
"Make your choice. Survivor or killer. As survivor... will you play altruistic saving your friends even if that means losing your own chance for survival? Or will you do things like dragging the killer to a hapless teammate tirelessly working on a generator. so the killer chases them instead merely buying yourself some time? As killer will you play ""fair"" trying to make an enjoyable gaming experience for everyone involved. Which can be either being ""nice"" letting some live and/or killing others or ""4k'ing"" (killing them all) fairly. Or will you try to ""tunnel"" someone out of the game (constantly going for them and killing them when you can even if another survivor is close by) or also ""camp"" the survivors while they are hooked and hope someone comes along and you go after them unless they run away too far and you go back to the hook for whatever reason... ?So many ways to play. So many perk builds to try."
Trash
What a time to be alive.10/10 would take cover from flying cubes again.
Great Game for an early access. I'm hooked!!!!
Staring at loading screens for hours simulator. No Alt+F4 function to speed up the process of not loading.
Great game loved the story
Good Game
Very Nice game Yes.
Though my early access review was positive I'm gonna be honest the game has changed alot some for the better some for the worst. 1. Where has the weather gone? it was fun when it might be raining or foggy and make the game more challeneging yeha it would you off to get sniped in the fog but it would also be funny and the dicersity was great. 2. Hackers...... seraiously do something about them please!......maybe impose region locks....3. The emotes and stuff just why te pose no purpose. BE PUBG NOT FORTNITE. 4. You' really went and introduced keys and creatws didn't you. This isn't no CSGO bull this is PUBG you added the microtransactions for nothing! Weapon skins really? Making a random create dropper instead of the free one for people is a move man.Bottom Line i still like pubg but its loseing its identity its become a csgo foortnite instead of focusing on making its own chracter. People aready baught the game now you're gonna charge us to unlock creates? Mate off. Don't become greedy s like EA when you have a good game going. People like this game hell i like this game but I'm not sure I like the direction the game is going in. Only time will tell I suppose.
Product received for free. Very good game but I think it should be free to play V
Gr8 game
"1/13/2050How did the world turn out the way it is now. Why the youth are being sent down the wrong path. Everytime I wonder this to myself I only hear one reply. It resounds in the back of my mind a distant fear. My only fear. It comes like a whisper. One word. ""Fortnite"". The very thought of the word sends a shiver down my spine. I laugh and shake the notion out of my mind I reminisce on the good ol' days of Minecraft... back when society had taste. Now society is ridden by a plague. ""Fornite "" the voice screams. ""FORTNITE!"" it yells! Make it stop. Please make it stop. Help me. They are coming and they won't stop. I can't give my son any money in the fear that he ends up like those other kids. They'd take the money and buy their foolish skins for themselves or worse influence my boy into that cursed game... If only I could educate them. Show them the truth. They think the poison that they willingly inject through their eyes is so amazing. No game needs developers that active. It's just bad news. There needs to be space between the developers and the users. And bugs? Those add character to the game. Without bugs in a game you just get a lifeless white hallway set in some dystopian future. There needs to be something that pulls you back to reality so that we can still grasp our humanity. Just thinking about the ideal state of a game reminds me of an old friend. Todd. A man of legend that quickly fell from grace because society just wasn't ready for his genius... That's a story for another time though. I must go now. They say the regime knows all. They'll know about this quickly and they're going to come for me. I have to leave with my son so that he may not end up like them.GoodbyeOh yeah this game makes me want to tonguepunch my son's fartbox"
Brutal but seems to be a better choice over H1Z1 or ARK considering the price and decent optimisation. The game doesn't succumb to survival cleches like zombies but instead focuses on the conflicts and peace between the players by implementing several mechanics for attacking and defending bases but also sharing houses and territory with other players.Edit Try modded if you're solo. Much better for solos than vanilla.
can't connect to online... ever. hacker spawned me cars and gave me money. 4 hours deep in this game but i love it. weird a triple A company put out this but whatever.
"This game is right up there on my list of EPIC games.. fix the hackers make sure it never becomes pay to win and keep adding weapons/maps... And I'll move PUBG above Witcher III on my personal ""AWESOME"" list. Lol"
online never ing works on this this is how u get 1 star.
I intruduced this game to my group of friends and from that moment we couldnt stop playing. Lots of good playing modes and constant DLC. Devs are really nice and are always interacting with community! Couldnt recommend it enough!
It's really great! Especially when u play with friends.
Mods banned by Take2. Thumbs down for me now.
Dead playerbaseFilled with hackersLoading times long enough to beat Dark SoulsImpossible to stay in one server for more than 10 minutesEmpty world
i like it nice game cool graphics scary weapons angry cops and you can drink beer and whiskey. 10/10.1
First Monster hunter game that I am playing! like it so far its good! 8.5 / 10

They ruined the game. Do not buy.
Fun yet full of bugs..still
Just one more game. Okay one more. Last one. Well I can't go out on a loss. Can't quit now I'm on fire....
Half of my playtime came from loading screens
the best FPS i have ever played
really a fun to play game
Wow after playing Fortnite it's clear what an unfinished piece of garbage this game is. What are the devs even doing on a daily basis? Not making the game fun that's for sure. And whoever thought a desert map would be a good idea should quit game design forever. Fortnite does everything better than this game. Where is the loot? It's too hard to find anything useful at all. I can't believe I was excited when they implemented mantling. Just shows how blind the devs are to what is actually needed. MAKE THE DAMN GAME FUN! This game is not fun this game is a job farming loot crates for Steam credit. And Miramar SUCKS.
It's boring to plaly alone and it is a grinding game but it's fun and with the EXP system coming out it should balence the game more.
Amazing game
You know what. The state of this game right now on 10/26/2017 is These people have plenty of money to get better servers and they just wont. They just released an update that has made mine and my all my friends game play expereance worse some how. Right now i wouldnt recommmend this game. They need to fix there PC issuses befor the create XBOX issues.
Initially this was a negative review. Now however I can finally recommend PUBG. They fixed the lag they've optimised the game and it's servers dropped a new map and a dozen new guns. As of launch after the usual launch hiccups it works. It just works. And it's about ing time.
"First I owned the PS3 version then bought the PC version lured in by some gameplays on youtube.I already finished story mode in the PS3 version (finished as in I got bored by the bland characters without any agency other than ""gotta make that paper brah"" and stopped playing the game because the world was boring and the cops were killing any and all fun to be had) so I basically bought this for online mode.The good things first OptimizationThe game runs great. The Framerate seldom dips. GraphicsIt looks pretty good.Now about the negative aspects. GTA online is a boring grind. I told myself I'd not care about money and levels but it turns out you have to and you have to grind the same few jobs over and over and over to get money and rank points to level up because EVERYTHING is hidden behind a pay and rank wall so tall Trump would tell Rockstar to take it down a notch. The payouts are really poor so it takes you forever to save up money for something you'd like but can't buy because your level isn't high enough. Now I wouldn't mind this if the races were fun but all I get is the same boring supercar race (looking at you congestion charge) over and over then maybe some ""muscle up"" perhaps one or another offroad race but they're all equally dull.Where the hell are the oddball races? Taking rusty tractors down Mt. Chiliad? Racing golf carts on a runway which planes are taking off and landing on? Cycling on the freeway in the opposing lane with traffic on? Helicopter races through the wind mill farm? Faggios through a cow farm? ANYTHING ELSE THAN ANOTHER ""DRIVE THIS EXOTIC SUPERTURD ON THE SAME COURSE YOU'VE DRIVEN ON COUNTLESS TIMES JUST TO GET THAT MEASLY PAYOUT?""Oh"" you'll say ""Just make these races yourself and then host them"".Yeah I'll make them and then grow a nice beard waiting for even one soul to join. Sounds like real fun.In the end this game feels like nothing but a skinner box to make people buy shark cards."
Pretty good atmosphere just not enough content for the price.
if i could use one word to decribe this gameoof
Amazing game improvements from its last generation. Amazing Graphics and 60 fps is just too good to let down.
Why not abolish 55kai in douyu.com? It's your manner 为什么不封了斗鱼直播平台的55开 这是贵公司的态度
This game is not yet OPTIMIZED still LOT OF BUGS and CONNECTION ISSUES and add SOLO FPP mode on South East Asia Server !Thanks.
"PROS +AMAZINGLY FUN INTENSE BATTLE ROYAL FIRST PERSON SHOOTER GAME.Devs continue to battle hackers with massive ban wavesReleasing new maps Reworked the whole crate / skin / level up systemAdding more gunsCONS / BUGS Desync servers causing you to get shot a second after running behind a wall for cover When first landing at the start with new snow map getting ""parachute freeze bug"" in air bug even sometimes getting heavy lag and rubberbanding some people even dc My squad can't see me on the map ""invisible bug"" but I'm right next to them Plain sight cheaters that ruin it especially once reaching into the top 10% ESP player location Aimbot Macro ""XTM rapid fire"" No Recoil Flying CarsUpdate 1/3/19 The cheaters are way less frequent now and there has been a huge wave of pro players account bans recently lol not so pro after all uh... OVERALL REVIEW I do recommend PUBG this shooter game can still be intensly fun and the graphics are nice too"
no
Good Game But its so lag
DLC money .
By far the worst matchmaking system on any online game I have ever played. Good luck trying to do missions with friends. Also for online mode expect about 80 percent of your time to be in loading screens.
vary vgood game even thogh i get 12 fps
Rust is Rust DBest survival game fun with friends and still developing hope it get more better then already is.......
Some people say they don't like soccer games or car racing games but they love Rocket League and it's easy to see why! Easy to get into but hard to master! It has become one of my recent favourite games to play and its even better when yopu play with mates.
a hy basketball car game dont play go outsidde and get some sunshine ing poopys
Always still fun
good game.
The developers release constant updates and often take community suggestions but ultimately they need to pull their heads out of their asses and understand that their game is an unbalanced piece of .The learning curve is too steep for me to recommend this game to anyone. You need an insane amount of commitment to this game to get anything done.
This is the WORST Ganker MMO ever created. You start nude with a rock and run into heavy armed players who kill you for the hell of it and getting revenge on them is the only motivation to play this P.O.S.This is worse than E.V.E. online and that s saying something. Buy Savage Lands instead is much better.
I bought the game about a month ago and I am really enjoying it It is definetly worth picking up some time and playing with friends or just playing online with people you never met and you can make friends. good game._.
Good game worth it.Dont be temped by shark cards.
Got Friends? Got Family?Not anymore )
parked on sidewalk buying guns cars next to me start to do shadow magic and levitate and are never to be seen again 11/10

Years later it's still a wonderful game to sit and play with friends. Just kick back with some music and have a few laughs while you dunk on each other.
loved it
Dont see how this game bad. Very good just needs a damn update xD
This game is swag to the max
This game could be awesome...but it seems lie ...uhhmm i mean Bluehole is doing nothing against cheaters doing nothing to improve the servers &gt dsync and rubber banding OP!!!! the fact they earned so much money with that game I see they are just greedy moth......... by doing a about improving the game!!!!!!!!!!

Very solid battle royale game surprisingly addicting. Hopefully they will optimise the game and it's servers soon cause this is a game I will certainly play on a weekly basis.
i just got the game like right now ended up waiting 30 mins at loading screen and getting stuck wasted my money??????
This game is fluppin great.
Play it with your friends. It's cool
havent played so much but a good game
Buy this
Dost dobrá OpenWorld hra do stylu realního života.Hra má fantastický příběh s fantastickýma postavami kradete auta okrádáte banky střílíte a žijete život.Online je taky dost dobrý jedinej problém je AntiCheat. Stává se dost často že hráč dostane ban i když nic neudělal.Jinak je to všechno super!
One of the best GTA's so far. It's really holding a good replay value with the added multiplayer content. I would definitely recommend!
It's Good.
))
Beyond the clusterf*cked UI the quality of life changes added in this game from the previous Monster Hunter series surely deserves a thumbs up.One just needs to get used to the controls (PC) and to master the movesets of your hunter and the monsters you hunt to get the best experience in this game.
There is NO LOOT IN THIS GAME its fun when u have loot BUT THERES NO LOOT I DIED 10 TIMES WITH NOTHING
awesome game! love it!
A perfect Remake that holds true to it's name.Insta buy!
If u like running over people while ur flippin' em the bird you'll enjoy this
love the game the moeny is worth make sure to join servers newly made or recently wiped in my opinion because base finding it hard if not love the game it's got a challenge the let's plays of it are sugar coded it takes longer than you think
Bugs Cheater and Chinese s
survivors play snake
Game is pretty chill
It's taking quite a while to finish loading.
It's a ing trash game with no community scammers and people named Gabe.
Dis game haz gunz and naked men You can also get raided by lots of naked men and they take your Gud gam 6/10 weenies rating. Can't believe a nekid man took my pants and my chicken.
WHY DID I PAY FOR THIS? crashes all the time cant play
Really fun game.It needs more variety in killing survivors.Advanced graphics settings would be nice in game.Buy this.
Great game online is super fun the singleplayer campaign is incredible easily one of the best games in the past 10 years. You should seriously play this if you haven't already. That being said I have to leave a negative review because even though this game is awesome Take Two's idea to shut down mods for the game is unnaceptable. I'm not in any way saying that this game is bad in fact I think most everyone leaving negative reviews likes the game but this is the best way to get back at Take Two for their decisons.
Great game.
Rust is one of the worst games to buy. I have 8K hours of play time i would know how bad the game is. the PvP in rust has no skill gap at all anyone can just get on the game and spray ak easy. you also have to spend hours farming for bp's and you cant even get good bp's out the barrels like you could in the old BP System like you get no reward now. solo player would never have a lvl 3 work bench because it takes way to long to farm it and the raiding is aids to before if you were a high hour player could get a base if they knew how the building worked but guess what all the low hour people were saying it is unfair that they could do that. so they took it out the game. now to raid a base you need to farm for like 24 rockets becaues sheet metal now takes 8 rockets to blow. Getting scrap is very hard and not for people in small group's or solo. the game is only for the fat zerg's now. Let's get more on how the PvP is bad though. First the ak before in the old Bp day's the ak took alot of skill to use becaues you just couldnt spray from 100 meter's away you had to tap which means you had to have some what of good aim. Even when you sprayed the old ak it was hard so you had to get good with it but guess what player's in rust didnt want to spend time in a game to get good with it yep you guessed it all the low hour noobs. Now the new ak anyone can spray it and yes that does mean your 80 year old grandma she can hop on this game and kill someone with hours. And the Dev's still dont think that is a problem becaues they havent changed it. To be fair i dont even think the DEV'S even play there own game to see the problems in there game. i dont think not once they have played a wipe and gone through what me and you go through they only care for the roleplay things now. They would rather add a chair in the game then to actually fix the BIG BUGS in there game. One more thing to this game will never be optimized they say they work on it but every week i get the same FPS sometimes even lower so if you dont have a good pc then dont even spend your money on this game it runs like i think thats all i have to say about this game. IF THE DEV'S READ THIS PLZ JUST FIX THE PVP AND MAKE IT TAKE SKILL AGAIN.
A NICE GAME!!!
Good competitive game would recommend.
Nice game
If you played The Culling before the cancer patch you will probably like this game. It's basically the same besides a lot more people and the combat is largely focussed around guns. So it will be pretty hard for the developers to make the combat system slower **cough**culling**. A large amount of the complaints for this game are focused around micro transactions. Something to note is that all of the items you can buy on the steam market are cosmetics that in no way alter your gameplay. On top of that if you are like me couldn't care less about running around in a yellow suit. You can just sell everything on the steam market. I've made like 7 dollars by selling garbage to kids with their moms credit card but if you get really lucky some items are worth hundreds. So there is that on top of the game being super fun(mainly with friends). Only con I can think of is it seems to mainly drive off your cpu. So if you have a great gpu and a ehh cpu like me you are probably going to be playing on low medium.
"I have purchased several copies of this game for friends. I give it two thumbs and a big smiley face. I have great hopes for this game despite its many current issues. This game has the potential to be a (s)team gaming juggernaut. That being said up until this release there have been many issues including stabilitysynchronizationwildly varied pings in game leading to ""pusher favoring"" in almost every situationabysmal frame ratesrubber bandingseeming inconsistent weapon characteristics and ballisticscomplete lack of any arena where one might practice combat before facing the hordes of experienced players waiting to eat noobs. h I really like this game and I hope it succeeds. h"
Grand Theft Auto Series Has Been Always on Of The Best games of All Time.And Now With GTA Online It's More Awesome And More Addictive. i Have Nothing Against This Game But After The recent Update Of the Game ( I Think Approximately At 12/13/2016 ) The Game Has So Much Lags And A lot Of Bugs With The New Special Vehicle Cargo Missions. To Steam And Rockstar I Hope That You Read This Comment That's Not Respectful and Fair To See Some Modders and Hackers Are Messing Up with your Game and Make your game Crash and So Laggy And Getting Alot of money without Any Effort.Please Improve your Anti Cheat/Anti Modding systems.

PULL UP AT YO CRIB WITH A STAPLE GUN
Only had this game for a few hours so won't review gameplay but I can say that this game runs acceptably on the lowest settings for those who aren't sure their laptop can run it. My laptop's graphics card is actually worse than the minimum requirement but i still can have fun despite some of the lag. Game as a whole 9/10. Game on lowest settings 7/10
Ultra Graphics &gt
&gt be me&gt get to top 10&gt step on a rock the wrong way and get stuck&gt die to the blue circle at #6And that's only one of many interesting features PUBG has to offer!sadfrog.jpg
This is an amazing game! Soccer and racing mixed together in fun team based action. A must buy!

Pew! Pew!
PUBG for life

it just unfair you work your off to find stone you find it then you die cause thirst or hunger its and also players are dont buy this game i got it last night at 11 pm it sucks bad
10/10 Would scream at the screen again
PUBG has some of the best shooting mechanics in any game. The weapons all feel very different from each other with the esceptions of a few pistols the recoil is very easy to control and every kill you get feels very satisfying. Most of the bugs have been ironed out in the recent patches and the servers feel much better with the recent update they got. The only parts that are noticibly buggy are landing around many buildings/trees or trying to pick items up using the pickup key and not the inventory. In conclusion PUBG is fun the bugs are not as bad as people make it out to be and its fun to shoot things
Lying devs.Another early access milking machine in bug hell.
Product received for free. this game is bad you every where you go dont buy it dont play its ruined my life forever so dont play it.
Agora o jogo ta descente! Otimo jogo )Bons servers (FINALMENTE)GTA CARA... PRECISO FALAR MAIS ALGO?
Easy to learn Hard to master. Personal performance game where you have nobody to blame but yourself if you screw up. Gets the adrenaline going like you are watching your favourite sport AND actually taking part in the match. Don't play if you are about to go to sleep. &lt 3 Rocket League 4eVa xxoo
terrible walking simulator just get killed while naked and afraid.
server is not stable sometime
"I can't win in this game I Won 0 times But it's addicting!The feel of the game is really realistic.The developers are working with the comunity really hard.I really worths it.The ""paid crates"" are not relevant I would buy 1 especific thing or 2 but if its alleatory I will not pay money to doestn't know what I am buying simple."
Great game. Still in Early Access stages but they are releasing updates mostly weekly with major updates monthly.
"Huge replay value. New update has solved alot of issues and they are working on ""Survive with Friends"" mode."
Fantastic 10/10
"game is terrible. i traded (i knocked him he knocked me) with a kid today and that was my breaking point. also heard a buggy rev behind me then it didn't make single noise untill it ran me over. couldn't hear it at all. THEN to top it all off i get one pumped by a shot gun when i sprayed him with a micro uzi because of dsync. done with it. brendan fix your damn game.ALSO https //clips.twitch.tv/ElatedInterestingAlmondUWothttps //clips.twitch.tv/CleanCautiousSushiStrawBearywatch these. this game is overrated garbage. ""its still in early access stop crying about it"" is no longer an excuse. this game is supposed to RELEASE NEXT MONTH and im still getting dsync. garbage game. h1&gt pubg at this point honestly. don't buy this game unless you like raging and garbage mechanics.you can literally loot for the WHOLE ENTIRE GAME THEN DIE TO THE STUPID CIRCLE. you can loot a WHOLE CITY AND FIND A M16 WITH 30/30 SHOTS.you can loot a whole buildin AT MILITARY BASE. A DAMN MILITARY BASE. and find a level 1 helmet and a machete.don't buy this game please save yourself"
Terrible just terrible. I wasn't able to play the game as it just crashed while loading in a match. Their support team told me I had a processor but it never reached more than 70% preformance when the game crashed because 'the processor reached max prefromance and could not handle it.' And my CPU was within the minimum spec list so clearly that's not why the game crashes. It's because PUBG have a completely support team and development team who keep on updating the game only to create more problems than they fix.
Great game! Dont trust anyone in this game! Everyman for himself!
microtransactions out the Hackers online. NO MODS. Loading screens.....oh god the loading screens. 50 of the 76 hours i have spent have been waiting through loading screens.
Take two is
I LOVE THIS IN GAME!!!!!
lets just go kill each other )
Ok so i see a lot of people complaining about hackers on official servers which is true and the impossibilities of playing solo however there are very good vanilla solo only 2x solo only servers which are indeed hackerfree. In my 600 hours or something I have not faced a single hacker because I never play on official servers. If you arr thinking to buy this game I definetly recommend it and if you are a solo play on solo only servers to make rust life much easier for you. E.g Wilsonator's solo server which does not die quick at the last day of wile expect at least 30 people.
One of the best game inn a while. Refreshing and new style of FPS gaming. Love the Replays. Death cam is nice to know how you died. Last man standing is the theme. Graphics could be better like in Battlefield 1. Over all game play is Awesome!!
Very fun
So many hack .
What a game!What a game!What a game!Chat disabled for 3 seconds.10/10 Would score aerial own goal again.
Money is hard to earn it takes alot of time and other players might kill you
Really good game. I had fun all the time. Online is such a good thing. You can play whith friends. Need just a little but of a bug fixes and thats all.
This game was very fun when I was able to play it it crashed a lot but I still enjoyed it and hoped it would get better.Now I can't even play at all I've tried a dozen times and it crashes every time. Really unfortunate I have gaming machine that is less than one year old and this game just dies repeatedly...what a shame.

with the new update the game runs horrible i ran it completely fine and now it skips horribly to the point where its not even fun to play wait to buy the game until its fixed

F*cking S*ite
Toxic but fun.
While this game is a really fun multiplayer game especially when playing alongside friends the game is too unstable for me to enjoy properly. A current issue I'm experiencing is reoccuring rubberbanding at the start of every match no matter the server or game ranked official or private match. A bit of digging turns up a lot of other people having various rubberbanding and lag issues as well.If you're able to enjoy the game without these issues it is a fun and challenging experience that rewards both individual skill as well as co ordinated teamwork. The physics are a bit cartoony but that seems to be somewhat of an artistic decision.When I'm able to play it it's a lot of fun. However the issues I'm having with the game is really frustrating and often disrupts what is otherwise a fun gaming session. A pity really. I do hope they patch the game up right quick.
I must have downloaded and deletd this game at least a few times already and it takes about two days to get it but it was worth it but I still rate it as the best GTA so far aside from the fact it lacks character creation training of the character to learn different moves and some off the classic arcade games and pool. It has some very creative missions and side missions with easily the best graphics and game dynamics I have seen working to date it does lack the simplicity of GTA one and two and at street level without the missions or side missions it can become tiresome the online play is also very satisfying I recommend buying it if you have the right system spec as long as Im not bugging about what it hasn't got I'd like to see it remade again in a more individualy customisable manor with missions made slightly differently more true to the original game based in a different decade lets hope theres plenty of remixes on the cards of the same game slightly different than it is and it would be hugely entertaining.
Great game I just don't like how there is different hit boxes for different cars I like playing with a good car that I like and I don't really like the octane. I do like how there are different playlists and the ranked playlists work pretty good. This is a fun game for anyone.
Nope. They refuse to fix their game. All they see are the dollars signs rolling in and ignore the MAJOR issues with a large portion of their playerbase. Their inability to limit the rampant hacking and cheating has gone too far. They know it's a major issue and yet it has been months and months with nothing. Every third game is ruined by a hacker BUT they care more about putting a unoptimized XBOX port out then fixing the issues staring the millions of customers in the face who purchased the game and are being ignored. Stop worrying about cosmetics and loot boxes because when you try and release something new down the road all of us customers will remember how you did NOTHING and will not purchase from these developers again. Think long and hard if you want to have a frustrating gaming experaince because PUBG Corp/Bluehole refuse to do anything that doesn't line their pockets. 100% the wrong way to do business.

Best survival game EVER
1 more game?
Very Nice Game
Dont buy this game until the devs fix the modder/hacker problem With the release of 1.0 and the new map I kid you not nearly every single round my death is because of modders. Until the devs actually do something about the constant instakill aimbots from across the map. DONT BUY THIS GAME! Outside of that the game is sweet which is why I have 500+ hours.
Plase bring back the blue prints!!! the xp system is horrible. had so much fun with the blue prints but ive stoped playing now cause you have to grind hard to level up. really hoping they will bting back the blue prints.
It's okay.
RIP Modding
Desync Lags Cheaters. ENOUGH SAID!Only hope is that this piece of trash die s fast and a GOOD publisher brings up a Battle Royale the playerbase deserves.
Product received for free. This game is good and I liked it but the game is but laggy
Its getting crowded by people who are playing as Flash and Robocop(cheaters). Does Anticheats even work or not steamfacepalm
Do you love cars?!Do you love Soccer?!AND THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!!!!About this game 1.Difficult at first2.Many Smurfs3.I recommend playing with friends
Great competitive game uber balanced.
I want this game but i don't have money.....
Best fun I've had in years very annoyed I didn't play online till recently
get rid of all the ing hackers
Its a realy good game. It doesnt matter if u play solo or in an group its always fun
melhor jogo ever
Muito bom o jogo!!!
The heart pumping thrill of Dayz but with quicker games and generally much more fun.
Great game
"""It better win ""Worst Game of the Year"" award."" Brendan Fraser(It's honestly a broken piece of game. It's in early access yes but why the does everyone ride this game? It's not even fun. Plus the head developer is a huge cuck trying to sue people that make other battle royale games because they ""stole"" his idea. The dumb cuck didn't invent ""battle royale"".)"
This game is a great game however it is lacking content. Once you get a base then you have nothing else to do But other than that I Love this game
I think that in game technology is moving faster than today's world and just this is disturbing me. Game mechanics very good Can be fun if you have friends but I just play with utku and that's enough for me.
This game is so badly optimized.Please go to other Battle Royale games like Ring of Elysium that in Early acess is way better than this. Also you should try Call of Duty Black Ops 4 BlackOut. But this one is paid.
Definately has a long way to go especially graphics wize but it's already really fun and tense and a good multiplayer experience.
Nice game. But try fix the bugs.
It is gud.
PLEASE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
take two
bEST gAME eVUH
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MAZING
The game is fun.you make money stupidly slow to encourage you to spent real money on shark cards. But dont worrie with each content update they introduce more expensive things for you to spend money one!
Great game 10/10
1 game is every activity but this game should play with friend 2 4
"just dont waste your time something thats not fun with hackers or chinese. "" "" Company the game and put its into players' mouth. gg"
everyone knew it would become an esport right away. Still is
its ight.
Rockstar/Take Two... get your together. I bought this game FOR modding... as I did GTAIV. I've never spent money on your damn shark cards or any other microtransaction and 99.99% of my GTAV activity is offline MODDING.
annoying bug but this game so good gameplay and shock ...MANDOM
Needs a lot of work to the servers and china seems to invaded most of them dont do duo as your partner will most probably kill you so get the game with a few people you know The game is fun but does get fustrating at times with lag and buildings that have not be drawn properly as i mean it looks like something out of minecraft Once this game is fully dev they will sort out the servers and prevent idiots.
This game it's my favourite one
To put it simply Monster Hunter World is a great experience if you like fighting giant monsters and granding for upgrades.(I am not good at reviews. I don't care.)
Great game! Worth the money!
I see a class action law suit against Take Two in the future.
So they ed with the #1 utility to make mods. They said it was because of hackers abusing this modding tool in GTA Online. Barring the fact that OpenIV didn't affect multiplayer... Where do they get off pretending they ever cared about hackers in Online???Ok game bad unregulated and unbalanced online mode and modding is now essentially illegal. God help anyone who got this game on PC just so they could mod it.
"Games like these are games that make me wish steam had a ""so so"" setting for reviews. As someone that's played every platform of PUBG I really love this game. There's nothing like it honestly. You can add attachments to weapons during the round which I've wanted in a game like this for what felt like forever and it has a certain degree of challenge and a learning curve that comes with it. Trying to find what attachments are the best with what guns. Also the maps are all pretty big and take a while to explore. While this game is really fun and is worth 30 dollars it is still pretty buggy for a full release and still isn't optimized like it should be. I understand that the maps are all huge and take a lot to handle them with the graphics but it seems like time after time especially on the new Sanhok map random fps drops happen that cost me a kill or the entire round of the game itself. Like a totally perfect loadout and about to get an awesome headshot but then the game freezes and the guy i shot at just lasers me. It really is a shame that this happens frequently but it seems like the devs are working hard to fix that. Anyways that was my 2 cents on PUBG I don't hate it nor do I want it 24/7 but it is a solid BR option."
the ultimate lag and bug fightits harder to start the game then the game it self
Terrible maintained game ya dingus crashes frequently constant issue with very long login time for GTA online so y ou sit there like a turkey offline mode is great. Need to fix these bugs for such a long standing game. I'm Dr. Steve Brule For your health.
Do you think mods should be outlawed take two does.
pre gud
Great game lol. I have on ps4 and xbox one as well
Another Good Game from CAPCOM
brought modding back review reflects this
love it &lt 3
Amazing gameYou get to stab peopleOr run away from the stabby peopleSeems like a decent ranked system so farNone existent hackersStill some bugs Amazingly Toxic communityVERY fun with friends8/10 would stab friends again
Product received for free. Other than the conection error this game is owesome. Play mechanics graphics etc. I really recommend this game fo new players
good game. I like it
I am tired of playing your new map. Can we finally have option to pick which map we want to play?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?
Best Game ever
VERY GOOD!
Servers are always on maintenance. What a bunch of amateur not able to built a server redundancy function with maintenance rollover that do not cause interuption. I wish I never purshase that game....
This game is good actually but there are some mistakes like vector and tommy gun is not very good and AKM is quite badmeanwhile scar and m4 is the best weapon kar86 should not one hit headshot helmet lvl 3 coz too opand Servers like SEA have no FPP yet at least some duo or squad not very good but the gameplay is good
Really fun and good game too bad it still has many game breaking bugs.
Good game
2018/06/22The new 4x4 map is good and the only map I'll be playing. Game runs terribly there was an update a while back that forced shadows to render at very long distances THAT'S what killed FPS for everyone. It used to run at 60FPS for me before then I clearly remember now its 40 45. Their business model is kind of screwed. Loot boxes AND a Fortnite style battle pass. Either one or the other but keeping both is greedy af.
Product received for free. At first I was confused by the weird concept of a game based around cars playing football and didn't really enjoy it but after a while i got the hang of it and the game felt really smooth and nice. At the start of the game i sadly didn't get a tutorial so i had to figure it out myself wich in a way was extreamly fun ! D I can only recomment this game it's got an amasing feel to it has great music and is generally amasing !
"Rust is an amazing game that offers a wide range of ways to enjoy it. If you have a ""me against the world"" mentality then you can play it that way. If you enjoy playing with others and being part of a team you can do that here. If you just simply want to be a villian and ruin other people's games then it's a possibility. There are no rules no force fed objectives only possibilities in this game and it's up to you to decide what's important where to start and what path you take.The idea of building yourself or your team to a status of being able to run the Rust world is interesting to say the least. You can gather tons of resources food weapons ammunition and tools all of which help you build your supremacy in the game. It's not just about obtaining those resources but it's also about keeping those resources safe against other players in the game. not only are there other players out there looking to take what you got you also have to navigate an unforgiving world full of zombies bears wolves and mother nature herself. If you like a challenge this game is for you and remember it's still only in alpha so I am expecting this game to grow into something iconic."
very fun and addicting game. considering its only alpha i have high hopes for this game. keep up the good work
Its acutally good for some reason?
Its in Sick!
This is a Good Game Just not for me..... Sound track is f*cking awesome tho D
Great game just need the game to be balanced that would be fun or add 2 killers instead of 1 that would be good to team up.or if somebody complain about the two killers we can make it hard for the survivors to unlock things and make it longer for them to open the doors or do an extra mission to open the biggest doors or something like that.That would be much more fun if the game is more balanced or they add another killer
I like this game. I really do. But god damn. IT TAKES AGES TO LOAD GRAND THEFT AUTO ONLINE. The longest time I waited was a full 24 hours. Not joking. By then I didn't even care. I just closed it. However. The pros for this game. Racing is extremely fun. With different modes. You can now play solo in GTA online. Which is great when you don't want 4 year olds messing up a mission for you. I love doing heists. Its exactly like payday 2. BUT BETTER. Tons of weapons mods. Cars that are updated and implemented into the game like every week.
This game is horrible because of how poorly it runs on my gaming PC. It is full of hackers. You can literally go google PUBG hacks and purchase them in 5 minutes. People are so bad at this game that in order to win they need hacks. The game is full of bugs. You can die spontaneously. The game crashes spontaneously. Motorcycles are possessed by demons. They will explode when you drive over a pebble. The list is endless. This is the worst game and I do not know why it is so popular. But it is still fun somehow.
fun fun fun trevor is the sht
waste of money
is so ing cool
Great game. The endless options of craftable weapons and armor keep this game interesting long after the story is completed. The story was quite enjoyable as well.
It's a great game although the connection (to the host/killer) can be terrible at times. One of the biggest problems I've seen in this game is that sometimes the killer will not kill survivors but rather befriend them and boost points with them. There should be a way to report this behavior.And honestly if you're a survivor and you boost with the killer you're a nerd who cares more about your rank and points than you do about playing the game right.
You can do practically everything in this game.
BETTER THEN H1Z1
Hackers.
Great game to communicate to fellow Aussies.
Updated on 17th of May 2018 Sorry but i have to change to not recommended because the developer and publisher slowly get to greedy in my opinion. They need a year to make a 4x4km map but are able to patch hundreds of crates into the game which need a key to be unlocked. This key can only be bought with real money. Performance is still ok but was way better in the beginning of 2018.Good job Playerunknown and team for this one it's really hard to this up after a so good start. Original review This game will kick H1Z1 from its throne. It's less buggy and actually fun. Hell such an intense and thrilling game. Would recommend. This is the new im gonna play for a long time...
NICE!
This is one of my favorite games I have ever played
veri nice
This game can be really frustrating at times but it's very rewarding. It almost gets me to tears when I cannot build a base without being killed but it's all worth it when I find and/or lure unsuspecting 10 year olds and force them to my will. Nothing is more empowering than standing over a naked 10 year old while you yourself have no pants on. Sometimes before killing these innocent little scoundrels I like to shove a rock up their butt or give them the choice between or jumping off my 12 story home. All in all i spend about 10 hours a day hunting down little children and shoving my entire package scrotum and all inside their bodies. I suggest you do the same. Buy the game. 69/10
Tons of fun!!!
When this game came out it had all sorts of problems that everyone almost gave up. After a month or two it improved alot and most of the issues that came out after the launch have since been fixed and the game was enjoyable again. Although this game needs more improvement it's still worth a try. I've been a fan of monster hunter since it came out early 2000 so I may be bias about it but every penny I gave them was a penny worth spending. I don't regret supporting this game and the games made before this. Good job capcom. Please don't change and be greedy like EA or anyone else. keep supporting MHW for as long as you can. We you're fans will keep supporting you and the developers of Monster Hunter. The best game in my opinion for all the years to come! Give it a try people. Wait for it to go on sale or support them on its current state. Happy Hunting Everyone! I rate this game as high as the stars Steam allows me! 10/10 An Absolute MAD LAD!!
Worth. Every. Dollars. EVER!
Tencent!!!
i love this game so much fun just wish it cost less xD
game is super buggy gets repetitive after a while bad connection with the servers poorly optimized
Utterly garbage yet addictive game.
10/10.
Good sport game
Best Game
Runs smooth on 1920x1200 res with a HD7950 3gb mostly maxed out at 50 60fps with the new AMD Catalyst Version 15.4 Beta drivers.No problem also with installing on SSD's. So so far so good. so can recommend it for now.Update runs smooth most of the time sometimes the fps sticks on 30 when i join the game which can be solved by going in graphic settings and back ingame. Dunno if thats a bug ingame or from my gpu though. They could work a bit more on the lag in tennis though )Buy if u just play the singleplayer.Dont buy if u like to play online.
Good game.
this game is one of the best games ive played you can raid bases with c4 that you got from an airdrop or crafting you can defend from a raid this game is amazing!!!!!
yes
10/10 for no reason
Overall a good horror game but there are still issues and bugs with the game. The devs try to patch/ fix but it takes time. Once you get past the rank 20s teammates face camping killers and bots you'll realize it's an OK game. It's just a game try to enjoy it. I really enjoy playing 4 man SWF.
What are they doing with this game? they're only making things worse
Very good game. I myself am not a big fan but do not take that in any way as this being a bad game. This is most likely one of the best games out there today. Very optimized and fun campain and multiplayer. A little bit unbalanced with the guns and ranks and multiplayers and can get a little bit boring doing missions but overall almost a perfect game.
I have no idea what I'm doing I love it.
Best type of open world survival game action u will get on a game.
A very fun and realistic game.Offline mode is very fun and online mode is a lot of fun.
disappointing
"Had this game since 2016 sucked at this game and this was the time when I had a bad PC. Over these 2 years I have developed my skills to become a Gold III. Not much compared to a Champ I or II but I felt that I accomplished a lot in this game. Got a high tier in the Rocket Pass to get all the way up to Tier 70. This game is very unique and fun and I had a lot of fun playing this game everyday with my friends. That is why I nominate this game for ""Better With Friends"". Thx Psyonix &lt 3"
mun ma ma
Honestly this game is a roller coaster of emotions there's vanilla servers which have 0 mods added nothing to help you in gather things faster which is nice but I don't recommend being solo on them or if you do start out as solo then get a friend or friends then there's modded servers these servers can vary you have servers where you can gather resources 2 10 times most servers above 3x are there to help you around the game then you have aim training and battlefield servers the servers mainly to help you control spray paterns these servers are great if you want to get better in the game.I recommend this game to people who don't get frustrated easily and for people that are okay with losing progress that you've put hours into this game is about gaining and losing there's s all over but sometimes you meet nice people which you begin a great experience with. If you buy this game good luck in the buttnaked world
I have never seen a game so filled with hackers in my life you want gear... this is how you do it. you build a small house and wait with a gun that has ammo untell a hacker walks into your house right through the door and you shoot him. Got 100% geared with in 15 seconds of playing. its fun other wise.
It's just a fun game through and through the community is mostly funny and enjoyable for the most part.If you just want something to mess around in on your free time this is that game.
GG taking down OpenIV
Muy divertido hacen falta un par de mapas más reparar los crasheos y listo.
no comments...just perfect

This game is absolutely amazing and i have put in countless hours in the last 2 weeks alone but one feature that i think would be super cool is to have stats for each individual in game gun and even possibly being able to level up your experience on that gun. This is just an idea though the game as it is now is great but i feel like if this feature was added it would also add to the longevity of the game itself.
Spawn &gt gather some stuff &gt don't find any food &gt gather more stuff while looking for food &gt nearly starve to death &gt finally find three mushrooms &gt eat mushrooms &gt suddenly wolf spawns &gt get killed &gt quit this game
i love trhis game its a great community along with excelent ervers.pros lots of gameplay value great community competitve many rank systems and daily challengescons the dekux dosnt really have any benift because you dont get any dlc not really worth the extra moneythe game kinda feels like the dlc is needed and perk mecaicsa dont work as well as they should along with game mecanics I.E nerfs and buffs change every update making the game have either too OP killers or too op surviors
Good game.
Here at Rockstar you're only allowed to do something if you pay us for it.With the attack on OpenIV TakeTwo essential killed single player modding for this game claiming that it opened the door for people to cheat online. Practices like this should not be tolerated and the backlash that TakeTwo is getting from this is very well deserved.As for my honest thoughts of the game I was able to get 200+ hours out of this game. The single player campaign is worth a playthrough but I've never been able to bring myself to do it again like with GTA San Andreas or GTA IV. GTA Online is an absolute trainwreck and TakeTwo's cash cow. You'll grind for hours sometimes days or weeks on end to get a new car or a bigger house. Shark Cards are a way that you can pay real world more for in my honest opinion disgustingly low amounts of in game currency for what you pay and how expensive everything is in the online mode. Hackers are everywhere and innocent people are consistently banned with no option for appeal while the real hackers run free.Story mode is 7/10 Decently fun and has a pretty good story.Online is a 2/10 You may find it fun for a bit but it quickly fades and it becomes a chore to do anything.EDIT Looks like TakeTwo has listened to the people are reversed their cease and desist of OpenIV. While this is definitely a step in the right direction the actions of TakeTwo should not be forgotten and they should be kept under a watchful eye.
The best shooting game for cheater.RIP.

"Good game idea addictive gameplay let down by poor controls inconsistent hit detection on inbound damage a multitude of softlocks and an overall lack of polish in terms of input handling and UI.Poor controls 8 way movement but only 4 way facing. Makes positive use of the analog stick tricky when you move diagonal is subject to finnicky zones cutting between up/down or left/right movement alongside diagonal movement. When using the d pad diagonal movement always faces the character up or down never left or right making targeting a hassle. Ledges are finnicky. Sometimes you fall down a pit with practically no provocation sometimes you have to lean on it for half a second before you actually jump down. Rolling over double wides in anything but ideal conditions has about even odds of you seeing the other side vs. seeing the door you came in on. Incoming damage is extremely unpredictable. Sometimes projectiles will hit hard cover sometimes they'll burst through it like it's not even there what finally set me off that it wasn't me was the fact that standing in the exact same location behind a pillar two long wise lava streams passed me... the first one missing completely the second nailing me. The register in the store can be tempermental sometimes requiring repositioning three or four times before allowing sales to a waiting customer.Poor UI A keyboard is also cool not. While I could get to the menu with the keyboard/gamepad switch option I was unable to figure out which key to press to actually get the UI to switch to the keyboard controls so I could see the rest of them. Gave up and just plugged in a gamepad. No ""sort my storage/inventory"" option. No ""repack my storage/inventory"" option. Walking into the dungeon resets any teleport you might have set without warning and without any ability to get it back. The teleport by your shop is just far enough out of eyeshot that it's quite possible to make it out of town without noticing you have a port up. With no fast way to switch cursor between storage and inventory when placing cursed items and causing items to be switched between inventories when over placing directly that ""mini game"" becomes bounds more tedious and much less enjoyable than it otherwise would be. No min/max recording in the merchant book regarding price reactions making finding the highest ""ideal"" price mildly obnoxious. Price reactions frequently fail to be recorded in the merchant book making finding the highest ""ideal"" price an active headache. Price bubbles on tables' lower items cover up the item above them making keeping track of what's actually out/on sale an annoyance. Trying to cursor in the up direction to the top left storage inventory slot causes the UI to switch to the previous chest instead of selecting the desired topmost leftmost item Not being able to save and put the game down at any time is an annoyance. Wishlisted item components show as wishlisted... even when they're supposed to be ""unknown.""Silver linings GREAT choice to allow crafting with vendors so long as you own the items needed they don't have to be in your inventory. GREAT choice to allow wishlisting stuff so you don't accidentally sell necessary crafting materials.Patched to a moderate degree could easily be worth the asking price of $20 but In its current state only a $5 game. Unfortunately it took me longer than the Steam return policy limits to come to that determination."
Super entretaining.
Honestly the most fun I've had online in ages. Fast paced and very satisfying when you score an incredible goal or pull off that 'epic' save. A must have for everyone's library!
too much grind this
Great survival game. Got #1.8/11 would get another chicken dinner.
All this time and the game is still a buggy piece of crap. It's fun when it works but that happens so rarely I find it hard to want to play again. Constant stutters and frame drops make the game unplayable at times. Quite often I find my teammates in the plane but I'm not since the game hasn't loaded for me yet. Some textures don't load until a minute after I've dropped. Just before writing this review a played a match with my friend where it wouldn't let me pick anything up. I could walk around I saw my friend picking stuff up. Turns out my character was still in the plane. This wasn't due to my internet since I had no lag while walking around and watching my friend. I paid $30 for this after the full release and hoped that I would get a finished game. Sadly that wasn't the case.
"Amazingly fun for a Game in Alpha. A lot of people running around with Rocks punching Trees Animals Zombies and other naked people with said rocks. Quite amusing to see honestly XD You also have the choice to censor or uncensor people so you can basically see ""Their Johnson hanging out feeling the breeze between their crack."" Now if you're not a fan of the ""One Eyed Snake"" or Another Man's Johnson. You can always go to console and type nudity.censor true (Or False if you wanna see If you are someone who gives up easily I would not recommend this game for you. Killing (PVP) is part of the game and the only way to counter act it is Get yourself weapons for self defense or avoid every player you see. Besides your neighbors They are a very valuable asset and will actually save your life when you're being raided (Experience) Try to get on peoples' good side and you can actually make it quite far in this game... or die repeatedly Having everything taken from you forcing you to start once again from the beginning.9/10 Very fun Amazing fun with friends but still in Alpha which involves plenty of bugs and glitches in the Game which hinders the experience. ""Should I get it"" yeah you should! If you don't You'll regret it when it's 30$ or more. Also made by ""Garrry Newman"" The guy who made Garry's Mod (Best Game ever Approx 1 000 hours on that game &lt 3)"

my gta v was installed i promise but now it says you need to install it again rockstar and steam help me i need answers or is it just windows problems
The servers can't even keep 4 people in the same session or game for more than 5 minutes anymore. It's been happening for an entire month with people dcing halfway through quests constantly. Enough is enough.Don't buy this game unless you intend to play solo.
Dear BLUEHOLE FIX YOUR DAMNED SERVERS!Love RednexicanEdit since this 1st review improvements have been steller.

Product received for free. went for a little nice swim and underwater mermaid wolf attacked me. 10/10
Product received for free. its not my forte
This game is actually pretty fun when you're winning and playing with your friends. And nothing beats the thrill of slamming in a difficult goal. But I'll be damned if this game doesn't have one of the most toxic communities I've seen it rivals CS GO sometimes. Other than that though I definitely recommend.Edit I hate this game now
外挂这么多也不管管 每把都不外挂打死 虽然九十八不贵但是也是花了钱的游戏体验差点也就算了但是外挂这么多这有点怕有点过份了
Gta online Rockstar servers are unavaiable right now Joinining session timed out saving failed unable to connect to rockstar 15+min loading screens Modders Other player survive 15 shots of rpg then he oneshots you unbalanced prices Pay to win Toxic community+Singleplayer story+Great mods+Best Gta ever made
Yes Please do
I love open world games and this one is probably my favorite!
Unable to zoom in Zoom in with every attachment leaves me with the basic no attachment zoom.
Rust literally just crashed and blue screened my computer. i know what game i wont be playing for a while
SERVERS ARE BROKEN ATM HOLY
What is Rust? rocks more wood guns and 7/10 would recommend.
As Take Two/Rockstar will be discovering there is always a line never wise to be crossed even for them.. yet they dared by essentially banning mods across the board. Power to them &amp so the far reaching consequences.
top game
I Did not pay R210 TO GET KILLED CONSTANTLY!!
Loads of fun great community (for the most part) and always scare inducing!
Very fun to play definitely worth for its price
Love it.
One of the most supported game I have ever played nice graphics and good story.
I highly recommend this game who like having patience in a shooter game and not rage when they die.
really good u will enjoy
This game is the ultimate time waster. You're only sin for playing this is believing even for a second that what you did in this game ment anything. Complete and total waste of time. I went in knowing full well what this game was. And I was not dissapointed. I can not recommend the game. Becausae it's not really a game. It's a time waster. A void. it's...lol...ahhh hahaha. It's nothing to be proud of playing. I will play again. But just to waste some time until something...else comes along.
I give this game a HUGE thumbs up because it is against mods.
no
"Do I like rust? Short answer No.Long answer?It's a fantastic game with lots of people around you but to even attempt to solo/duo in this game in any server that isn't heavilly admined is pretty impossible. You can spend as much time as you want on this game and still end up at square one you HAVE to invest a solid 8/9 hours into it in one sitting to be at a point where people won't raid you when you go to bed.And if it so happens that during that 8 or 9 hours that someone who has no motive other than to make your time then my friend you're back to square one.People say ""oh but it's just rust!"" no it's not it's a ing fantastic display of a social experiment give people the ability to be s to people with no reprocussions and this is what spawns.I hear all the time oh rust legacy you used to be able to meet people have fun help each other.Nah. Not now.So do I like rust? Sure when there's 10 of us to farm quickly and get a base built I LOVE rust but to spend your time on your own? no.Don't purchase if you're a solo player."
best game for players who love football and cars
After 224 hrs spent on this game I cannot recommend it to anybody. The game is in a very poor state. Most of the issues come from BlueHole's decision to utilize client side processing for practically everything fundamental to this game. Guys with technical know how can come bash me all they want about it but all i know is this. This game is ripe full of hackers and bugs that people exploit and ruin the gaming experience for everybody else almost exclusively due to the client side aspects of this game. For me i could care less about vaulting new maps new guns or graphical updates when the fundamental FPS aspect of this game is soo unwieldy and clumsy. From dying behind cover to out of region desyncers taking 4 5 shots on your screen only to turn around and two shot you. This game finds soo many ways to be completely abysmal even tho the underlying premise of the game has soo much potential. Maybe in the future I'll consider returning to this game when Bluehole decides to be a responsible game developer and focus on fixing current broken fundamental game mechanics instead of pushing out microtransactions superficial updates and claiming this game is ready for the Pro scene.
all my hours come from the loading screen
Very Surprised with my laptop specs that this game can run perfectly! no flaws Nothing. Very fun game to play with friends but the people online are some of them. 10/10
UMMMMM well IT'S AND 0k g me na mean ting is itz lottaz cheatAz
love the concept but there's just too many cheaters and especially BUGS. devs should work on this game faster before they lose more players.
I rate this game an undisputable 10/10 it just has to be and here is why my friends. The community is rather toxic always ticks a box for me straight away Matchmaking not too bad of a problem coming in with a whopping 90% of the killers lobby dodging me because I'm one of those cool guys with a legacy item like it makes me pro DBD supposedly s My final reason (all though i have loads more but i don't want to bore you with an essay like most reviews) for recommending this fantastic game has to be the satisfaction of tea bagging and pallet looping against the killers to make them cry its just simply lovely to watch it don't half make me chuckle.
"I WANT LENNY SKIN C ON GUYS 6/10 why ? 60% of players are ""kill on sight"" and 60% is big number...."
I may not have the full 100 hours under my belt currently i am at 4 hours but believe me this is the most fun i've had in 2 years! The controls bit wonky at the start but really easy to pick up but hard to master. So many different strategies in one football/soccer game! And it even is entertaining to watch! I bought this game and it did NOT dissapoint i know i will get many hours out of this game!The lootboxes are quite a let down but oh well wat can you do about it
its ing grait game it worth 60$ thank R
Absolutely great game especially if playing online. The bad thing is it takes quite a lot of storage and lags a LOT if you have a bad computer.
First game that I've ever gone back and requested a refund. I'll stick to ARK thank you.
A few fps drop in first area and area 14 on first map (I assume it's heavier on those specific part).Other than that the game run smoothly on my pc (Win10 1060 6GB 6700K 16GB RAM).Satisfying kill for the big monsters Edit 2 Multiplayer seems to be fixed with recent patch.
"10/10 for the Story Mode10/10 for the bonus DLC ""Loading Screen Simulator""Doing Heists without friends it's a death sentence.""Hide and Seek with Hackers"" it's a pretty decent feature.Also each time I receive incoming calls I get a mini hearth attack. At least Roman Bellic isn't calling."
Since modding has been made a thing again I feel I should change my review
I love pubg however there are a few critical things that need addressing.First of all there's the Chinese problem. And no I'm not being racist but it is severely impacting every mode of gameplay.Solo You see ping abusing in multiple games with not great netcode. Most of them however fix that issue by either region locking or otherwise. It has been getting increasingly frustrating landing muiltiple point blank shotgun shots and then getting taken out by a pistol.Hacking is also a major issue. It's reported that 99% of pubg hacks come out of China and that is extremely noticable even in NA servers.When asked about region locking the brain dead dev playerunknown said he wasn't going to promote xenophobia in the form of region locking Chinese players to AS servers. This is a joke.In duos and squads it's also an issue. Although this one is preventable by joining pubg LFG discords sometimes you just want to play squads or duos from the games. 90% of the times I've chose to do so my entire squad only spoke Chinese. Given that communication is the major aspect of the team gamemodes it destroys the experience.My second and major gripe with the game is the stupid map. How difficult is it to implement a preferred map setting? Miramar (Desert) has a much higher play percentage which means that it takes upwards of 10 Miramar games to find one Eringale one. This leads to players getting burnt out of the new map and stop playing due to it. This includes me. I had to join and leave 13 Miramar games just to get one on Eringale earlier today. I joined the game and got killed almost instantly by someone very suspicious. Hopefully Bluehole can actually listen to the community as games like Rainbow 6 and the battlefield franchise has done or their game is going to go all the way down the deep end and sit with H1Z1 as bigger better BR's come out.I will not be playing this game until these problems are addressed and frankly I won't recommend it either.
There is a good game.But then it will be duplicated a week later
much goodso gamevery grathic
aww man i love this game so much!!!1 i think u shoukd buy this game. BUT ONLY IF U HAVE A GOOD PC! Love this! kEEp up the good work PUBG!!
toxic
Dope but CPU bound especially in city areas.
Just started this game a couple days ago but I'm already in love with it. It's a fun realistic survival game. I highly recommend it to other gamers.
Favorite and only sports game I play
great and fun game to play with your friends.
One of the most expensive drop i have ever seen!
Best game ever
I started playing GTA back when I was a lot younger. Vice City is what got me into the series however none of the other games caught my attention quite like 5 did. I played GTA IV a lot but never completed the campaign because I always got bored halfway through. GTA V on the other hand... I COULD NOT PUT DOWN. I love every aspect of it. (Other than the story not including more heists.) The 3 protagonists are thought out very well. They each have so much character and soul and rockstar packed in a great story to go with it. Just from the prologue I got instantly HOOKED! I would recommend this game to everyone and anyone no matter what games they're into. It's worth finishing at least once. (This is my 3rd time owning the game!) Rockstar did a great job with map design and their attention to detail is INCREDIBLE. So many little obscure details you wouldn't find in any other game that makes GTA V so unique. From the different sounds from cars squishing of wet shoes water only going up to the spot where you actually got wet. There's a lot of people who are whining about the game not getting campaign DLC. Would it have been nice? Sure! Who doesn't like extra content to their favorite games. HOWEVER for the longest time. When you bought a game that's exactly what you got. Despite that Rockstar did a damn well job with GTA V. It'll go down as one of my favorite games.

Highly addictive and immensely enjoyable. Do yourself a favor and mute everyone else except your team and if you're alone. Record your gameplay if you are worried about being banned. Just focus on the game and have fun after all it's only a game.
Product received for free. 给腾讯 散了吧 这游戏要倒了
The game isn't bad just hope you don't kill a streamer or theres a 50/50 change u get banned. Plus the game auto reverting me to asia after every game is getting really old.
Really god game for being alpha! D
Stop reading this and go play the game.
gay
i like the game even with all bad thinks inside D still better than sims fortnite )
Crazy game... still feel like a playing solo's so i wait to get a partner to play Rust with. Amazing fun though when you play it. There is always something new to try out in Rust. weather it's from creating a new base design or locating an outrageous area to build your base in. The map always has something in package for the players.
mm
Hmm. This game is quite the 50/50. Met some chav in a random four man team called Xenon and honestly he ruined the whole experience for me. Valve please ban this kid. 'hmm interesting gary'/10
Trully an amazing game. Fun to play with friends but those russian guys / toxic people need to calm TF down.
needs the abitility to add bots to zombie mode and everything and the ability to change the diffuculty on the bots then it will get a good recommendation from me.
Perfect Gameplay.!
GTA Loading Screens V
ITS GTA

IS a good game but with a bad computer you can't play this game then you need to play the beta other wise you just lost 20 $
Pretty good game
I freakin love this game! This is one of my favorite video game of all time since San Andreas and definitely my most favorite video game franchises of all time! Trust me. Play this game and you'll won't regret it. I know online mode might suck because of the toxic community but you could always play on story mode instead or even close friend session to prevent random players from entering your session. This game have controversies but honestly who cares about controversies if the gameplay is fun! Besides you let your kids play GTA! So it's technically your fault!
ball and a car
Good game.
LOADING SIMULATOR ONLINE Money is being earned slowly and everything is so expensive that it makes you buy Shark cards and Cheater and Modder on every corner .. R * does not have money for proper anti cheat protection ... pity
More addictive than nicotine infused heroin
Just like in school Nobody ever passes to meI get yelled atEveryone pushes me around10/10
interesting
its not perfect but i love it
This game is literally the biggest pile of i have ever played. H1 is a tier 1 game compared to this boring cuck game.
Incredible for EA. No game makes your heart race like this one.
Great Animations. Awesome game play. Fantastic s*#t your pants moments. Hope they add TrackIR support in the near future.
very noice
best servers ever&lt 3+rep rip
Honestly a great game Game itself is very fun and immersive The Devolopers are great about updating the game and meeting deadlines and the playerbase is very high and the community is funny as hell. My only complaint is the hackers and heavy aimbot use. #Regionlockchina
Maybe it was its immersive gameplay or its gripping story... its well crafted characters immaculate design or addictive multiplayer. Whatever the reason the winner of 2018's Game of the Year Award is an instant classic.
This game... oh man where do I begin? This game even though it's still in alpha is a hell of a lot of fun. The thing I found fun in this game was trying to find my friends in this huge map it was extremely fun. I kept running into strangers who would sometimes give me stuff or attack me and take my stuff. Once I found my friends then the fun really kicked in. We ran around found some towns that were radiated and looted the buildings for some top notch items. The game is constantly updating with new stuff and I think I will keep playing this game even when the game fully releases. I highly recommend this for people who like survival games that aren't over the top realistic like DayZ.
Really enjoy this game even though it's still technically alpha. Looks good gameplay is good and already well worth the $20 I spent. Lots of potential!
Very funny and interesting game but I recommend you to buy it on sale .
Good game
Jesus Christ this game is a to play and I hate it so much I don't even know why I bought it.And it is just simply that that makes PUBG 1000x better than stupid Fortnite.
Playing this game at 12 Fps sucks but it is real fun and i hope to get a new pc soon or they optimise the game sonner
Awesome game on XBOX. Can not get to run longer than an hour on PC and its not due to a lacking PC. Tech Support is useless and i've spent as much time searching forums for solutions as i have playing the game. And from the forums my experience is not unique... Bummer loved this franchise.
Great port! I run the game in 4k with my GTX 970 and get over 60fps! Great looking and fun game!
This game was better 2 years ago....
Can I get a refund on Steam?
Frustrating at first due to to the learning gap and having to loot the terrain for a few hours but if you put time into it it's a fun game
Community really sucks but there are servers with good ones. Worth the time it takes to find one. Definitely recommend.
gr8 game
Very fun game
good but unstable but good
Product received for free. very good story game

rigged asf
Cool
its very good )
There should be full mod support on here on steam workshop. Otherwise most reviews are accurate on the single player being good(but disappointing since dlc wise rockstar is really obsessed on the multiplayer angle of things sadly) and the multiplayer leaving alot to be desired. I refuse to pay for ingame money so it's more of a grind for me. and i Just try to be miminalistic with what I do especially bullets wise. But again I'd just get the game for single player since it has a decent length and very detailed open world multiplayer has potential but rockstar should really focus on the single player side of their games in general.Aside from that I hope for gta 6 they build on their open world design and let you go in more buildings and the police system is argubably my favorite out of the other open world games I've played. I'd recommend that if you only care for single player get the ps4 version and vice versa pc(or for mods although there is no convient steam workshop section for this game)
pretty solid game for a alpha. rust is a game to watch
The game is Rust and full of errors.
"GTA V was an awesome game in it's prime fun with friends alone and even with strangers. When I say ""in it's prime"" I mean the classic console versions not this PC version.Multiplayer There are many aspects I would talk about like the long long loading screens or the non existent balancing between high levels and low levels. But the problem that made me stop playing is that the concentration of cheaters is embarrassingly high I would join a open world server and I would say there's a 50/50 chance to meet a cheater. They would often be invincible and once in a while the cheater would annihilate EVERYBODY at the same time which could be up to 30 players depending if the server was full. Sometimes you would get lucky and get a friendly cheater who gives free money but that ruins the whole point of the game to earn money by doing jobs and spend it on upgrading your stuff. Now I also hear the game's developer firm ""Rockstar"" is trying to get rid of cheaters and removing ""illegitimately"" obtained money by going on a banning spree which resulted in innocent players getting banned as well as their in game money. Online GTA on PC is just unplayable.Singleplayer The singleplayer is what the past GTA games were but better. Big open world to explore with several different environments long and entertaining story to play through. But this is no where worth the 59.99 $ with that money you can buy two good games like PUB G &amp CS GO and still have left over money. I do NOT recommend this game on PC just stick to the console version."
Honestly I love this game expect there is of course there are flaws and the one thats most concerning to me is the fact that you can barely shoot through the fence and now the vaulting sometimes glitches and you get stuck in a corner or something and end up dying (due to zone or just quit because you can't move)
Great game hampered by rampant hacking. Anti cheating measures are so woefully bad. When you commit to invest a 30 minute chunk of time to one round of a game only to be killed from across the map with a P1911 headshot while you have a helmet on... you know they have some work to do. In the last several days I've seen hackers in 25% of rounds. Sucking the fun right out...
it's okay i guess
ya damn game though my spoacebvar was brokeninstead it m y dumbass macros and had me hereforlike 6 hours trying toput aspacebar backon sincerely a six year customer
good game
I don't even like this game because I suck at it but somehow I'm still playing and buying the DLC that has added significant gameplay enhancements. Hope they replace the ball with a testicle soon
good
basically running simulator 2017
GG
more cheaters
I only wish I had more friends to play with. This game is amazing made even better if you have 2 3 buddies to adventure with. 10/10 would reccommend.
This Game is the worst Game i've ever played in my entire life. So iam Bronze I on 3 vs 3 Standart and on 3 vs 3 iam Platinum I iam playing like Diamond. Now iam stuck in Bronze cause my Mates are bumping me ever single time! So worst Game I ever played.
Where do I even begin. This game is probably the most addicting game that I have ever played. There is so much to do and it is just so fun. The gunfights in this game are so surreal. They draw you in and feel like no other game ever has. You're afraid of losing everything you worked for. Then there is the otherside I hate this game with a flaming passion. It makes you want to eat your mouse and put a hole in your monitor but it always makes you come back for more. I tip my hat to Facepunch for making such a unique game. I absolutely recommend this game if you hate your life and have (or dont want) any kind of social life.
SO GOOD.
"Addictive game however still very buggy. Don't let the whole ""1.0 now availible!"" marketing get you. All they are doing is adding features and changing UI instead of fixing core issues with the game that desperatley need fixing. It still has glitchy parachuting bad hit detection and no ping lock so basically you play with a whole bunch of Asians all the time. I would wait a little bit longer for this game to REALLY come out of early access because right now it doesn't feel how a fully released game should."
really fun game!!!!!
It's late at night.The store owner cleans the counter down it's quiet he's got time.The bell rings a customer enters. The shop keeper looks up and says 'Hello!'The customer says nothing walks up to the counter and browses the confectionery blankly.The customer pockets several 'P's &amp Q's' leading to the shopkeeper to yell in alarm.Without a change in heart rate or facial expression the customer scales the counter and proceeds to savagely boot the shopkeeper in the face. Jumping off the customer stabs the shopkeeper to death and takes all of the money from the till.The customer swaggers from behind the counter and casually strolls outside.A police car rounds the corner drifting easily into the gas station where the crime was committed. However the officers slightly overshot the corner and careened into a petrol pump.The officers the customer and the shopkeeper's brutalised corpse are blown to smithereens.10/10
Wow
This.Game.Ruined.My.Life.
Game was fun... direction it is headed is very clear albeit very disappointing.Crack down on game interaction beta bug experience (which is half the fun) user freedom open world experience ... the list goes on. If you got into Battlegrounds at the start then you had your fun for $30.00... if you haven't yet wait for the next big beta/open world arena style game that delivers without baby restrictions this one will phase out within the next few months.
ya me gusta very nice game makes me very excited when i play game yummy
The game is just simply awesome.
One of my favorite games unfortunately its infected and its not a survival game any more ......if you enjoy the hacker vs hacker dm games this is for you if not stay away
This is one of the few early access games actually worth looking at. I've put a lot of hours into this game with my friends and I've loved watching it grow over time. I will say that the experience is not for everyone. You will lose 99.99% of the time and it will be frustrating. I would advise people to try out a match or two and then determine if they would like to keep the game or refund it.Overall PUBG is a very enjoyable experience alone or with friends. I highly recommend it.
Good console port. Runs well with my GTX 1070 and 1440p monitor and I get around 90 FPS consistantly. Remappable keybinds is also a great plus.
I am the Gabgolabgolab and I do not approve of this game.

It's ok I guess?
"The review below is from before they have done major changes to the game""If you are looking for PVP game this is goodif you are looking for a survival game look else whereWhat rust used to be no longer exsistit is now built for the csgo audience""This game has gone though so many changes It really has changed as a game and Its really fun and great."
A simple skill heavy game. Football with cars. Good
WHY DID YOU ADD THE DESERT MAP AND WHY CAN'T I CHOOSE NOT TO PLAY ON IT
0/10 minecraft rip off
i dont need to buy salt from the store anymore with these new reviews
Great game!
This is the ultimate game. Period. It will be a major game changer for the Oculus Rift when the Rift support is official and optimized. Right now you can connect the Rift but the over exaggerated head movements of the character cause nausea (at least for me).The only criticism I have that they did not change the mission design a lot compared to the older iterations of GTA the 3 Characters do not really make a difference for the game mechanics but enrich the story a lot. But overall I think that is okay because that is a typical GTA trademark and gives the violence a needed cartoony touch.
Moral of the story people are jerks.
ois kannattanu korjata tää peli ennenku julukasette namut on silti hyve xd
Really fun game!
converted me to muslim 10/10 would jihad again
The game is fun but there are lots of hackers on GTA Online.
Played about 30hrs in the BETA. I loved this game. Perfect mix between ARMA and H1Z1. Way more guns and equipment. I love the ability to customize with my opticals and grips etc. It's a lot slower than H1 so if that's not your thing I don't think you'll like this game. This game isn't focusing on skins which is nice too. It's updating constantly and working on optimization updates from what I've heard. This game still has a way to go though but I think that the devs really do give a and are working hard to fix any issues. 8.5/10 would recommend
Pros JustOneMoreGameCons Sex? No thanks babe I'd rather play Rocket League!
Have been waiting for the servers optimization since the start and still nothing.
good game
Constant battle to get that delicious chicken dinner &lt 3
It's like fifa except you aren't getting pummeled by Jamaicans
I love the range of freedom in the game and the variety of weapons and gear to obtain
It's a terrible game. Anti plug in systems are bad. Game companies don't focus on anti plug in systems. They mess up a lot of clothes and gun skin.
This game is addicting and fun as hell! the one draw back ive been involved in is when you know you shoot ppl and YOU CLEARLY see the hit marks but they are bullet proof and turn around and kill you witha shotty 100 meters away lol. one shot. game will make you rage unless your a god
For early access this game is pretty good. I have enjoyed getting my kicked on several occassions especially when i am running into the last 2 circles and just randomly shot from somewhere i was looking but completely unable to see the player until i was already dead lol..However my only actual problem is the reward system. I have opened 2 rewards nows. I have received 1 set of boots. Yes 2 reward chests have netted me 1 set of boots that i already owned anyways. Completely confused on why you would put a currency into the game and a reward chest only to give nothing on the first reward chest and 1 set of boots that come with the game in the second. Kind of dumbfounding.
Great game.........very addictive and its only in pregame state!! I am looking forward to what they will offer...........to keep us?
Great but frustraiting game
It lets you punch naked bald men in the
I think anyone could talk about this game for hours but I ll keep it briefWith a developer like rock star make a great game and then goes on to promise that the game would be constantly be supported by great FREE dlc you are blown away and expect a lot. Then the devs went and took a sledge hammer to the foundations and broke that like it was an elderly person with brittle bones syndrome. I will not be talking about the single player because it is good and I believe it should carry the game but then the updates affected overall performance and really messed up the great experience i had. The multiplayer even after ll these years feels gimmicky repetitive and boring without friends but this doesn t mean anything. The micro transactions are ridiculous and while the DLC is free all of the new guns vetches property and other extravagant thing must be bought with in game money and in short are way to expensive because there is no constant way to earn a lot in this game making it feel like a grind. In short great game but the devs went a royally buggered it up. Honestly it feels like this game is dying and is desperately trying to stay relevant to kind of like Dwayne Johnson in Tooth Fairy but at least that movie was from the start GTA online could of been a diamond but turned into a heap of in the shape of a diamond
I say this is a really good game. Its fun to play with friends but also fun by yourself too. I would reccommend duos as it is my favorite game mode because you don't have to worry about too many people shooting you but you also get in some pretty intense firefights. I played with a 1060 3gb and the game ran great. The developers update this game constantly and do really good stuff with the game to make it more fun and enjoyable. It takes just a few hours to get used to the game play and then after that its super fun getting kills and those chicken dinners.
This is honestly the hardest most frustrating most broken most unfair game I've ever loved.
Not too bad very frustrating sometimes.
Pretty good job so far
What a nice game!
how can gat code GTA V
Great game.
Fun game even for someone who don't like playing shooting games! Just play casually and you'll be fine!
Too much grinding.And no not that kind of grinding.
It s very fun!!! (Controller only)
amazing game even though it was just released it has thousands of players. this game is really going to take off.
i can never play as a survivor it says waiting forever and when i push back it makes the noise but doesnt work other than that i like the game
To be honest i must say that this game was way better with no cartoonyish ways. The problem now is that some peoples computers cannot handle it now. It also is just plain strange the cartoonish aspect to the game makes it seem less realistic in the times when it was better and much more fun to play with friends. I wish that you would bring back like it was when it first came out i had a blast and made much more friends (and enemies). That is why i do not reccomend unless they bring it back (sorry rust ily). Plz bring back the beginning of rust!!!!! Hippo&lt 3
"Although I dislike the way the shrinking borders are implemented such that you very frequently find yourself doing nothing but sprint towards the next play area for the entire duration of a round without stopping just to keep ahead of the encroaching border until you are finally one shot by an enemy who was waiting for you to arrive hiding in a location that made it impossible for you to even see them that isn't the reason why I'm giving it a negative review.Although I dislike the degree to which your success depends on getting lucky and finding one of the more powerful weapons (english for dummies ""degree to which your success depends on luck"" is not the same as saying ""the game is entirely dependant on luck"") and also getting a vehicle and also getting some kind of optics for your gun that lets you see another player before they see you that isn't the reason why I'm giving it a negative review.Although I dislike the fact that despite the map being truly enormous the game always plays out the same and the different areas of the map don't open up the possibility for new strategies hazards rewards or gameplay that isn't the reason why I'm giving it a negative review.Although I dislike the fact that there is only one map and there aren't different environments like deserts or snow or thick forests or swamps that have unique weather effects that impact the game in different ways and there is no night time scenario and in the 20 hours I've played I have only seen rain ONCE that isn't the reason why I'm giving it a negative review.And although I dislike the fact that in any given encounter between two players the third person perspective gives one of them a massive advantage over the other like how the player who is opening a door can see the player inside the room when that player can't see them or how positioning the camera correctly lets you see someone through a window who can't see you that isn't the reason why I'm giving it a negative review.No the reason I'm giving it a negative review is because this game has already sold over 5.5 million copies. This game is such a massive game changing phenomenon that it doesn't matter if I or even the entire userbase of Steam join in the chorus of negative reviews complaining about micro transactions and warning people not to buy it. It's like reviewing the Half Life series 20 years later and saying ""Don't buy these games because Valve still hasn't made Half Life 3 and probably never will"". You're a little late it's already a massive success. The people who are the type of gamer who would be interested in this game appear to have already bought it and any review at this point whether it is positive or negative is just whispers in the wind."

Everything grandiose has already been written about GTA V and there is nothing really that I can add to what has already been described more beautifully than I could possibly prose. So just read some other reviews because this one will simply reaffirm what you'll read everywhere else.
Its a really good game probably one of my favorites right now. The game still needs some work. Dont waste your time buying crates you just get the same **** over again.
its coiol
"Buy. It. NOW!!!. Its worth 20$ infact its worth more! But u should have a pretty good PC to run it. If you first buy it and it lags just open the console by pressing F1 and type in ""grass.on false"" and it will turn the grass off. if it still lags turn down your quality of graphics and if it still lags... Then deal with it thats All I can help with. but BUY IT. P.S not saying it WILL lag but if ur comp is bad it might"
Recommended for all gamers.Fun and addictive best to play with friends. Pros Customizable cars. Unlockable customizables. Variety of maps. Variety of settings you don't have to just play a regular game you can change gravity ball weight ball shape etc. Good soundtrack could use more but not complaining. Keeps you busy for hours. Awesome DLCs.Cons I believe they made it so you can only get some drops if you play online matches rough for those who dislike playing online. Playing online tends to force you to turn your graphics quality basically all the way down depending where you connect. The AI sucks when starting out on Rookie. They tend to score on their own goal. Extremely funny nonetheless.

if you have friends it's a very nice game but i think it's too early to buy it!! but it's cool have nice features like build a house and customize it! it's cool try it if you want.
I could wake up get ready for church and attend church and pray with jesus before multiplayer mode loads
ing br&gt
Played it a little Its nice
Very fun Battle Royale style game. I enjoy the game. IMO I like H1Z1 a little more. But this is less buggy than that.
Play this game to get chainsawed through lockers.
This game is absolutely amazing!
I have this game for short time and from beginning it was legendary. I know it has many bugs but for me the bugs makes a game better
Really good fun with friends!

This game is very enjoyable to play with friends (as survivors obviously) but playing the killer is what I enjoy most it can be strategic and it is the best feeling when you absolutely toture the out of a sweaty group of tri hard survivors )But there can be very annoying bugs like glitch spots where you can't move for the rest of the game also there's a thing called rank reset which is a thing that can be very annoying for lower rank players wanting to rank up.
It's getting better but I think blackout is better in many ways
I really like this game but the way you have to wait for an eternity before you actually get into a game only to find that other players were disconnected (not voluntarily).... You guys really need to fix the matchmaking queue it just takes too much time man.
"PUBG玩了快350个小时了 感慨颇深 I have played PUBG for 350 hours and I have lots of things to say.首先 这款游戏的确是好游戏 这一点我们必须承认 我的推荐是给这款游戏的 Firstly this game is really nice we must admit it.IT IS A GOOD GAME.但是现在PUBG的游戏环境实在实在是太差了 But the enviroment of this game is too bad.为什么 因为外挂 但是又不仅仅是因为外挂 Why?Because of those hackers.(But it's not just the bag of hackers).现在 PUBG里外挂已经十分猖獗了 加速 自瞄 透视 无后坐 锁血 甚至是路飞挂 一拳超人挂 Nowadays the hackers in PUBG are very rampant.Speeding up Automatic aiming perspective men no recoil Invincible men and even ""Monkey D Luffy"" hackers ""One Punch Man"" hackers!这些外挂严重破坏了我们的游戏体验 These hackers have destoried our experence of playing.但是我们对此无可奈何 But we have nothing to do about it.诚然 在PUBG里 90 以上的外挂都来自中国 Truely more than 90 hackers are from China in PUBG.虽然我无法代表全体中国人 但是我还是要向各位热爱PUBG的玩家说一声 对不起 Although I can't represent all of Chinese I still want to say to all of you who love PUBG SORRY.在中国 我们将这些开挂的人称为 孤儿 神仙 我真的希望那些孤儿别再做这样的烦人的事情 In China we call the hackers 'orphans' and 'gods' .I really hope those orphans do not do such annoying things in the game.哦对了 我来解释一下 孤儿 ""神仙 这两个词的含义吧 Oh I think I should tell you what's the meaning of them.孤儿象征着我们全体绿色玩家对开挂者的父母的亲切问候 这是在游戏里是一个贬义词 Orphans symbolize the cordial greetings of all us to the parents of those hackers.This is a derogatory word in the game.神仙代表外挂无所不能 在游戏里 'Gods' means they can do everything.(in game)我想让你们明白事是不是所有中国人都是开挂的 也不是所有中国人都进游戏就开始骂 CAO NI MA'的 I hope to let you understand that not every Chinese is hacker and not everyone who is in the game like to say'CAO NI MA' everywhere.虽然从整体上看 我们的素质的确不高 As a whole we do not have a high quality.但是这就是你们听到中文或者被打死就开始喊 曹尼玛中国人 的理由 But is it the reason of you to say 'Fu.ck you Chinese' when you hearing Chinese or be shot by us?????我们是真的很委屈 你们为什么这么做 We are really grieved.Why do you do this??我理解你们被挂打死的心情 但是我们也在被外挂怼啊 I comprehend your mood when you knocked down by hackers but we are shot by them too!现在我认为在PUBG里的有如下的这几种人 以爱国为理由恶意组队的红衣军 外挂 试图诛仙的玩家 骂中国人的玩家 骂外国人的中国人 一脸委屈关掉语音的中国人 起哄高喊 China NO.1""和 Taiwan NO.1""的外国人和事不关己的围观群众 I consider that there are these kinds of people in PUBG the Malicious teams of 'army with red clothes' and they usually use 'loving our country' to be their reason HACKERS players who want to kill 'gods' players who scold the Chinese Chinese who scold the other the Chinese who turn off the phonetics with Injustice faces foreigners booing and shouting ""China NO.1"" and ""Taiwan NO.1"" and a crowd of onlookers.也许大多数人听不懂现在中国人在广场和飞机上到底在说什么 Maybe lots of you can't understand what are Chinese speaking on the squae and the plane.我能给你们举出一些真实的例子 I can tell you some ture examples.谁在那边放歌 关上 Who is playing songs??!Switch off!能听得到么 Can you hear me?来 左右左右站着的是煞笔啊 站着的是煞笔 Come on!Left right left right the standing men are motherf.uc.k.ers.(this is a sentence of a song)机场卖挂 机场卖挂 Sell Sell how to be a hacker in airport sell sell (someone usually say this when he want to go to airport.Oh he must be very low.)是中国人的跳机场 中国人跳机场 紧接着会有一大群中国人开始骂这个喊话的 Flying to school if you are Chinese!Flying to school if you are Chinese!(and Then there will be a large group of Chinese start to scold the speaker.CAO NI MA fu.ck you bi.tch your head is broken?!)总之 希望你们理解 我们也很讨厌红衣军 外挂 我们也希望有一个绿色的游戏环境 All in all I hope you to know we don't like 'army with red clothes' and hackers.We wanna a green game environment.但是直到有一天 我突然看到有人说要锁中国区 steam上甚至出现了呼吁锁区的讨论组 But one day I suddenly find someone saying that please lock Chinese region!!!And there are even some groups appeal for LOCKING REGION???????当时我的心真的拔凉拔凉的 My heart was nearly frozen at that time.啊 的确 是我们不好 是中国的外挂太多了 Oh really.It's our bag there are too many Chinese hackers.但是我能确定一点 一旦锁区 PUBG就会变成第二个H1Z1 But if you do so PUBG will become the second H1Z1.而且外挂的数量肯定会变的更多 And the number of hacker will rise more.他们开得起一天 100的外挂 就用得起一个月 30的VPN They can use the program of hacker which spend them 100 per day they can have 30 per month VPN.而且如果锁区 就会给红衣军正当的理由 And if the region is locked it will give the Red Army a justifiable reason.所以 请不要锁区 这是一个真正热爱PUBG的中国玩家的心声 So please don't lock region this is the heart of a Chinese player who really loves PUBG.我的英语不是很好 我只是个学生 雅思5.0的水平(虽然已经能申请加拿大的大学了 My English is not good I am a student I only get 5.0 in IELTS. Although the mark is enough for me to apply for the university in Canada)如果有错的地方 请原谅我 If there are somthing wrong please forgive me.如果你真的理解我的这篇评测 请帮我顶上去 让更多的人看到这篇评测 If you really understand my review please help it to top up and let more people see this review.哦 还有 虽然我的头像很滑稽 但是我现在超认真的说 Oh what is more though my avatar is very funny I am very serious!!!!!谢谢qwq 233333333 emmmmmmmmmm wwwwwwwwwwwwThank you sir as.s we can"
I would kinda recommend this game but not really killers disconnect after 10 mins of trying find a game or they will leave mid game after using gained items so they are wasted and now to end it all my 185 hours worth of progress has been bugged and now it's dead
Decent addition to the GTA series. The game play was ok and the graphics were ok. The game was buggy about half way through and I just stopped playing because I didnt want to start over. End of the day I give this GTA a 7/10.
takes a beefy computer
Except for the optimization issues a great game. 3 million people can't be wrong.(That's what they said about Donald Trump).
On behalf of the OpenIV team you
Open game Enter Server Walk Around Find Hut Find Gun Kill Someone Feel Good Never Play Game Again 10/10
Greate Game. The makers are the makers of Garry's Mod and so far they have put allot of effort into this though it still seems as if they are unsure of which direction they want to go with the game. This game has good potential but I haven't played it in a long while since I have lost my appeal towards it. I have trust in the maker that it will come back around.
Good game some bugs but that's not a problem for an early access game. I love the feel of the guns in the game they feel realistic. I would definitely recommend this game over H1Z1. It This game is like so much better. The guns feel better the weather the graphics the gameplay. Well Cheers Mate.
nice graphics sometimes a bit laggy
fun game worht the money
Its isnt optimised well
Too many hackers to recommand an otherwise fun game
Great game ruined by greed.
they add more skins than fixing the stupid game
Outside of Mos Eisley spaceport you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
Liquid smooth game. Should be less needs of micro transactions though.
Incredibly laggy even on the best of machines and connnections. Poor network code altogether it's not unusual to get frozen in place while in game until the server sorts itself out. Random bugs will get you stuck on surfaces and in objects. Yes it's Early Access but wait until they do some serious repair on this before spending money.
I loved to play GTA 5. Rockstar Rocks
Nice ING game you ing SPERGLORD HIT. Holy it pisses me off when some unoriginal assholish dickweed decides it would just be ING HILARIOUS to make the SAME. OVERUSED. GAME. What do you even ing hope to gain out of this? Karma? Well you're certainly getting that cause it seems like a lot of other inbred ing autistic are thinking you're just ING HILARIOUS and that this GAME HASN'T BEEN MADE A BILLION ING TIMES. you.
I rate it 8/8 m8. okay gr8 game m8.
Never come across a hacker. Lag is minimal but is dependant on so many connectivity factors it's unfair to blame Bluehole/PUBG Corp. It's a lot of fun. It's not the final ever version so expect future refinements. It's come a LONG way since the beginning of Early Access.tl dr Quit yer whining.
I was unrightfuly banned for 30 days and reset all becasue a piece of hacker/modder
The game its self is amazing. It is one of the best games i have played. The largest problem i have with it is it takes FOREVER to find a game as a killer.edit it seems that more people are playing this game now so it is much faster to find a game now.edit 2 the escape hatch really needs some rebalancing. right now it is practicly a guarantee that the last survivor will escape. if they made it so the hatch only opened if there is only 1 or 2 generators left or made it so it does not open at all but make the key to it more common to find i think it would feel a bit more balanced.
Fired at someone two times got fired back at 500 times. 2/500 would fire again.
Still super fun
this game bbad
I am not off.
Love this
I leik
The potential in this game is unreal.Currently In my opinion it's just a time waster and a very good one. It's the best battle royal game I have played However it's far from perfect.Pros Good laugh playing in a squad. One of the best experiences gaming in this game. Match making is good Never had a connection issue and joined a game within seconds Easy Learning curve Jump out of a plane look for s**t move to playing area shoot s**t Die or win. Massive support from developers updating all time Controls and key bindings are goodCons The character movement and camera is clunky Ranking system needs implementing Get paired with similar ranking/style of play people. Needs a ar**hole meter How many times your team kill blow cars up in team ETC This game needs to get rid of 3rd person. 3rd person in this game RUINS it. Periscope camera in this game BLUGH. If you are hiding behind a wall/tree whatever you should not be able to see me. RUINS EMIRSION Even though the map is big The map is SUPER bland. Needs some form of A.I. Needs some better bushes Needs some better buildings. Graphics are Bantha p*ss. It's 2017 Graphics Should be of some quality however It runs well. Vehicles are stupid they look/feel/drive like they are meant for mine craft So clunky and blocky URGHYes Its Alpha/Beta/Whatever. How ever the developer has attached a 26.99 price tag and for that price it ISN'T worth a buy. S**t graphics Mediocre gun play Bland world Boring after 2 3 Games Lack of content
Naked people everywhere
"I will soon surpiass 1000 hours on rust. Im sure if the game had not split once upon a time id have close to 1500 2000. This by far has been one of the best games ive ver owned even to this day they continue to update and improve the game. I revisit the game every few months for hours and hours of fun. There are some things you should know before you play. 1 Have thick skin Because you will die ""alot"" and loose everything you own. Sometimes it will trigger your worse than a SJW at a convention. But when you do reach that epic loot room goals and raid all of your enemies. It will be the best feeling ever!2 Never expect to enjoy the game without devoting time to learn it. Some gamers think just pressing buttons and laughing is the best way to play a game. this game is truly only mastered by those willing to research base design armor choices base locations and just the ability to be stealthy. You cant play rust without truly putting forth effort. So if you refused to even try once in grade school go back to fortnight.3 Its only a game! Just remember that everytime you spawn on a beach with nothing but a rock and torch only to be shot in the head by a man with every single piece of gear in the game including a AK!4 Dont trust Friduwolf he's a hacker!"
Basically an unfinished slot machine
While the progress from legacy is impressive the game itself seems to play as follows SpawnFind a tree (you might have to run for up to 5 minutes to get to one)Make a mapMake better tools if you happen to find stoneGet killed while harvesting for tier 2 tools (if you weren't spotted by someone with firearms or a wolf during the previous steps)Can't give it a thumbs up anymore.
I think this is da best game ever so much gameplay and so addictive first it was kicking then it was ramming the ball with a car now its slam dunking with a car.
First game that I...100% ed x2Bought 2 times (PS4)Bought all DLC's x2Played for more than 250 hoursPlayed on my new GPUPlayed online multiplayer (I'm a single player person) that's saying a lot right there if you can't find something in this game you like there is something wrong with you even if it's just the music
good game
good game.
"This game is the same Sh** since it started .. no Progression .. and what a Fake on that new ""amazing"" Loading Screen before a Match starts.. dreadful Graphics and Asset Flip. That s all."
Yes.
blueba.. you know )
I origanlly downvoted this game but now that they are releasing the 1.0 update and i actually played it on the test servers. I would recommened this to any BR fan. I just hope they fixed the server stability issues.
nice game
Ha what
The game has a lot of crashing issues on the latest NVIDIA GPU drivers and even bluescreened my PC once. The game crashed 6 times on the opening sequence alone and I kept on trying to get it to work. After a lot of struggling I managed to get past the opening but the game still crashes in the middle of the first mission that you are given and that is on top of the game has some pretty severe performance issues like stuttering and low FPS even on my midrange hardware.There is also a lack of options to disable motion blur and mouse smoothing and there's no option for ultrawides so for those who are picky about that too I'd steer clear.This port is pretty bad. A shame since the engine's (that they used) previous versions ran significantly better since there's no other way to play this game than on consoles (Where it runs worse) and that I had a bit of fun despite the large sums of crashes and issues.This is why you should never preorder AAA games. Hopefully since Devil May Cry 5 is targeting 60FPS on consoles the PC version will fare much better.
This game is ing awesome.I do not know what the sun feels like anymore.If I were to die today I would be very upset that I couldnt play this game anymore.10/10 would recommend great fun
Great game with the most complelling mystery that still hasn't been solved! Watch Whizl on youtube. He makes great videos on the mystery.
#REGION LOCK CHINAbeen playing fps games since cs 1.6 till cs go and other worthy mentions like rainbow six siege l4d2 and battlefield was excited when pubg first came out since it offers a new competitive shooting game. took me nearly a few weeks to learn the controls the map layouts and even though i enjoy playing on solo memorable moments is playing with my friends till we even opened a discord channel so we can communicate in game better. however sadly to say this game is trash now. due to the fact that there are too many hackers currently i left 3rd person to play in ffp since there are less hackers but its all the same now. countless times we end up dying to hackers and its always the same nickname the same china pandatv nickname or some random numbers . this game is utter rubbish. we should just boycott it its either no recoil hacks esp hack or speed hack. the people at blueballs company ain't doing anything. just taking money and wiping china butt hole
yes
Terrible company. Sad to see a game like this dying because of that.
If you play cassually or competitivly the game is great fun and you'll often be loosing your time playing.
Can I get a refund?
Really a good game to enjoy!
thanks for screwing us R* and T2 bring us back modding
Good idea best game for fun
I take this to a positive review when take two stops being such a massive ing So in this game you play as a developer and company named Rockstar who are held hostage. The takers are these greedy scumbags who don't see the true potential of having an open market. They want communism and to control everything to come and those who speak up against it are boned.
Well I gotta say this is the most balance open world survival game I have ever played! It is so addictive! WORTH TO BUY
so much potential .... yet just like every other game released in our generation they honestly do not care about its player base or they would fix core issues such as horrendous server t but instead they listen to the children who complain about crouch jumping and feel vaulting is more important that fixing the game gg7th april 2018 UPDATEif you thought things couldnt get any worse they did.SKINS new maps but still cheaters asians and arabs ruin eu and north american servers.want to have fun when playing a game ? dont play pubg .... your paying for the privilidge of playing cheaters and ping abusers.once again good job bluehole for listening to the community JOKEpull out some paper money .... lay it in a ashtray and burn it ..... you just had more fun than people playing this game.
Buy $30 worth of bullets and shoot your tiny brain out for even thinking about buying this game
This is the best game for teamwork you can play as a survivor and play with your friends or you can play as a killer and kill your friend orrandom people. 10/10
I'm only reviewing this for the badge.
frustrating but fun.
says im missing file priveledges. i paid for it. can someone help?
"Multiplayer has the worst matchmaking I've ever experienced when trying to play with friends. The load times make it much worse when you have to try over and over and over to get into a mission with a friend. A simple ""join with friends"" wouldnt be that hard to add into this game. If you're planning to play with friends I don't recommend this game."
game the devs
Fun game with a different concept.
Very addictive game when playing online multiplayer. One game is 5 minutes it always fits in when you have a bit of spare time left.Also this game is very cool when you are having friends over. You can play with 4 people with controllers on a big screen really nice.
The game will not work 4/5 times (it keeps crashing). Then the few times I do get on it was not very noob friendly at all. There needs to be a short built in start up area for people to learn the rope before they are let in the wild. If the game would run without crashing I might of given it a better chance but I feel like I wasted my money DO NOT BUY.
Take 2 broke modding don't care about the game I bought twice anymore and won't buy any more 2k games which is too bad because they own some good studios but as a single player can't have this assault on modding the best part of PC gaming.
i cannot play this game THIER IS a problem themide is is letting me do re inStall
gta 5 ((
its lit
Fun to play with friends.
its pretty good and getting better
I think this is a very good game and i think everyone should get the game
FIFA with cars but with a better soundtrack and camera angle overall 10/10 D
Gameplay is good but unfinished unoptimized laggy servers etc just make it unplayable.
Apart from annoying login proccess each time you visit loby very positive effort if you like solo or teamplay survival based game which keeps you on your toes PUBG is the answer despite being an Alpha however more game modes and play areas/maps would be great.
Nice game
Always something new to learn and improve on. Never gets dull.
RIP GTA V Modding 2017
fun singleplayer online not so much
Doesnt work
Emezing!
Yo im asking like WHY THE YOU PUT FREDDY BUT NOT MY FAVORITE JASON WTF!!!! I WANT JASON WE WANT JASON DLC !!!!!! plz like soo they can see my Jason post
Better than h1z1 !
poo
Looting suspense action.. can do almost anything in this game..! Something about dropping 100 players on a large remote island to duke it out or have 4 player teams is awesome. Every round is different. Listen for footsteps or shots fired and watch out! Sometimes the play mechanics can be difficult but overall with the superb graphics and varied scenes the game is playable for hours and hours. Add a 4th map and would be worth $59.99 easily..!! Join in and have fun.. winner winner chicken dinner!!
Super fun gameplay with great graphics and cars would reccomend
with just over 600 hours into the game and playing from it's early days i seen this games good days and bad. i played with people from all over the world (not by choice on that one..) it saddens me to say that i am finally giving up on PUBG. i been watching this game over the past few months waiting for it to get fixed but non the less i dont see it coming. the game started off with 14 million players and well 13 mill band due to multiple reasons. (recoil not being there targeting auto locking nothing but head shots ect) and with this latest patch it still hasn't gotten better they are still causing people to pay for crate and skins to help fill there pockets even more (was 14 million people buying the game at 40$ not enough for you?) more so even more bugs are still popping up the latest with this review is the servers. get into a match and at 7 seconds on the timer till match start the 80+ people are lagged out and sent to the main screen.i really wouldn't recommend this myself however at this point im giving up on this game and dare i say it...and i really dont want to i would rather buy call of duty and even suggest others for there battle royal over trying to find a half a** good match here
not what i expected...
Years of playability. Would love to see some mod supp via workshop! Such a fun engine. SUPER No. #1 Golden Tiger Claw poke of Approval
This game is probably my 2nd favorite game on Steam. This game while repetitive is very fun. I have heard a lot of my friends say it is repetitive and they get tired of it quickly. I agree that it is repetitive but I never am bored of it. This game is so much fun with a friend or two. If you don't have a friend to play with you don't even bother. I personally don't enjoy playing this game by myself. Solos is not very fun unless you are a god. This game also requires a lot of dedication. If you do not put at least 100 hours in the game you will get frustrated by how bad you are. I have put nearly 800 hours in the game and I am still only slightly above average. I would recommend this game to everyone. It is definitely worth $20.
STUPID ING PIECE OF
"This game is hella lit fam. If you enjoy getting told that a 10 year old sleeps with your mom on the reg 10/10 would recomend. Then after word you proceed to get gangbanged by a 4 man squad that will one hit with a P92 pistol from 100ft away while youre auto running up a hill just so that they can dip their balls in your mouth and say "" China numba 1! "" So without a doubt you should get this game. 69/69 will play again."
Hunt some monsters get some bones grind them
R.I.P OpenIV you will be missed.
China number one!
Remove the only thing i play this game for
Having quite a bit of trouble just to get the game to run. Hoping a refund is possible even if the time is over the two hour or so limit. Haven't even been able to play it. When I try to run it with steam it says the launch was failed so hopefully an update will help.
I don't often buy early access games but when I do I make sure they are great. This game is already a lot of fun and if the developer keeps improving it it's going to end up being an incredible game. There is some jank and the servers can be iffy at times. Those things need to be fixed.
Great game very fun to play especially with teammates. Recommended.
it is a very good Game.Would give 11/10 for it
Game is pretty fun. Ranking system is kinda bogus and the community is pretty toxic. I'm still here tho so

Amazing game ! get rid of hackers !!!
Product received for free. This is a awesome game
Firstly This Game Should Be Called Dead By Loading! Because By The Time You Get A Game You Age 30 Years!Secondly They Should Have Dedicated Servers Would Get Rid Of Most The Problems!Also When You Are In A Friends Lobby You Keep Getting Cannot Start With 0 Killers Well Obviously Not As We Are A Lobby Of Surviviours!Apart From Them Few Teething Problems Its Really Is A Good Game When You Finally Get One That Is!Sort It Out Please!!!!
the only ''battle royale'' game that is somewhat fun to play but most of the time is a bore unless hitting people with cars.

Very awesome the graphics and and the story line. 9/10 definitely buy this * on sale*
This is the futher this game is life. i am very happy because i buy this game. +rep for developers
Fun with a friend but if not I guess it can be fun.
solo is bore
Hell yeah!!!...8/10
I honestly don't get it. Why is this so popular? It's exactly like H1Z1 but with worse connectivity issues and hit reg. H1 came first so why the hate for H1 and the praise for PUBG? They're both terrible RNG based broken games.
poorly optimized
GUD GAMENEED UPDATEEDIT SO MANY HACKERS BAD GAME
nice multiplayer
SCREW THE UPDAATE
Greedy Bunghole
Updates are constantly released during prime time instead of off time. This alone deserves a downvote.
HI I want to change left hand holding guns and some tools. just like 'cross fire' how can i change it ?
The removal of the zombies took away a huge element to the game. I know they don't want to be a zombie survival game just a survival game which is fine. But bring in something new/different like dinosaurs or something. The engine and fine and I don't mind the alpha the game just needs a direction.
I love this game to pieces but i need a group of people to play it with. Most of my other friends don't have much interest in the game. Anyway. If your looking to group up and do heists and have fun like most youtubers do such as Goldglove and Vern. HMU! Just please be over 16 years old.. And don't have a mic or static in the backround! HMU!!!

Awesome fast paced game. Physics are good and game looks great. Haven't enjoyed a game this much in years.
It is a very fun game. A lot of cars with customizations you can play for hours and hours.This game is awesome. If you were like me and couldn't decide whether to buy it or not I suggest buying it. It won't let you down.

Recommended Awesome Theft game ever love it thug life peace out.
i do think that terrian should play more of a role i as more small cliffs that drop down into a heavy foliage...that are so dense that you have to commit to the foliage to be able to see in the ravine. heavy grass doesnt count..but it does and doesn't because of distance...the open spaces are WAY to plentiful...either add more inbetween or do ravines with the normal grass...ehh its perfect i think. n then some extra thick double up grass that is actually green green not that seeweed .. so that first person you would really stand if you wanted to see properly over it..but while crouch moving you could see somewut but you would have to stand to actually check just grass and hedgerows.... plz and at a distance plz remember that grass doesnt load in...so if you do make foliage make it to were there are some spots that can abuse this...but mostly dont allow for grass rendering distances to ruin your foliage ares cuz its wayyyyy to under tree'd ....
Kinda fun
Now after many many hours on the Xbox 360 &gt PS4 &gt PC this game turns into quite the money pit. The main story is amazing just like any rockstar game but the online is awful. Unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket this game gets boring once you've done the story.

"Game is so good for everyone who like to play battle royale games PUBG For Real Mens ""Hey i am real man"""
"I've played 64 hours of Rust most of them in what's now called Legacy. What seems to be a ""throw everyone in an empty world"" simulator it ends up being most appropriately compared to human fecies. We've had alot of fun mostly due to funny bugs and ugly animations. Two hours after joining a server starting with nothing but a stone in your hand and a torch in your bag you feel like you've ""completed the game"". You're now seated in an impenetrable fortress with 30 000 wood in your chest and 10 furnaces running an industrial smelting operation. And you can craft everything in the game.As far as a survival games goes this really is comparable to human fecies animals can't attack you Zombies are removed. Gathering metal from one vein gives you metal for days and 10 trees chopped down would suffice for building an impenetrable house."

Oh behalf of the OpenIV team. Screw you Take2
Power and finesse baby power and finesse.
This game lacks style in many ways. It's the typical run and wait until you're killed. The killer has a huge advantage over the player. No weapons or anything. The survivors are weak and they feel like it's the first time they have seen the world. Come on Jason was better than this in many ways. DO NOT BUY you won't like it. I've played challenging games like Dark Souls 3 and it's a give and take. This is just an $ r pe.
its a very good game ya
fun game
An amazing game for the entire duration that it took me to complete it.
Really bad optimization lost a lot of matches because of it.
Go play the darwin project or the culling 2

Very fun. Improvements keep coming. No reason not to play this.
This Is a great game great idea... except for connection issues. every other game I own runs just fine online but when it comes to puk bg it just has so many issues when trying to enter the game I have great internet and a solid personally built compuer but no mater what there are issues when trying to enter the game initially or trying to enter a match Ive had things happen where it just freezes on the loading screan until im almost hitting the ground and habe thenworst position to not loading at all then theres the issue that once you land the buildings do not load despite the map never changing I've owned the game for three or four months and still no changes it only gets worse it actually ran better when it first came out. this game is not worth the money they are charging for it anymore and with the money they have made you would think they would have improved on this but alas there seems to be no hope for improvement. I'm just about done with dealing with it. not worth the money there are plenty of games similar that you can get that don't have these issues and have other game modes.

A Fukn Abortion of Optimisationhitches on a OC 1080Ti i5 8600K 5.150Ghz system. NO WORD COMMUNICATED RELATING TO OPTIMISATION UPDATESits a freefloating shiteshow is what it isworst port i have ever playedMatmaking is trash even after the patch you are cut off from people you still could mathmake with and wont connect you at all unless the connection to them are tip top i never met norwegians in games but in this i do all of the time! the rest of the world is very limited access. so what you end up with is not being able to find what you need like lobbies farming spesific monstersGreat game but cant recommend
Please put on an SSD.
The only this that is trash is how you get suspeded from online or not I got suspeded from gta online untill 8/28/18 for know ing reason
the best game
Product received for free. I like this game its so funny
Single Player masterfully crafted world to mess around in. Not a fan of being an a hole to everyone you meet but a man s gotta hustle to make his green.Multiplayer No thank you.
Story was great multiplayer is slow servers kinda suck people getting banned from shark cards sounds awful. Well worth it during a sale. Wouldn't pay full price until these issues are resolved completely. Got it for 40 bucksEdit Not cool to take down modded servers. Grabbing my pitchfork
Great game the microtransactions are completely cosmetic. No reason to whine about them being monetized. It can be frustrating getting killed seemingly out of nowhere but you'll be doping the same yourself. It's all worth it for the chicken dinner.
"Do I recommend this game? HA HA HA. Is that even a question? This early access is absolutely phenomenal is it perfect? My heavens means no way but it's like CSGO it's the same thing over and over but it NEVER GETS OLD. I find myself concentrating so much harder than I ever have in a game before because you are alway in panic mode scavenging while watching your back listening for cars and footsteps checking your coordinates. It's just a darn good game. If you don't like it go play your ""king of the krap"" because even though I like H1Z1 this isn't a comparison. Almost identical concept? Heck yeah and guess what it's 10 times better. I can play on almost all high settings (i5 7500 1050ti ssc 16gb ram) and only drop my lowest while parachuting in the rain to say 30fps and I keep a steady 50 65 at all times which is perfectly playable. So if you are questioning if you should steal your moms credit card or sell those CSGO skins for this game yes yes you should because having 630 hrs on CSGO and it being one of my favorite games ever I can promise you I won't be playing it half as much as I used to."
Rage quitters and vaulters ruined the game. Uninstalled.
Now this game is the best battleground game
"I can't say anything about multiplayer because quite frankly whenever I tried doing hunts with other players no one joined and I'm not someone who likes to wait (10+ minutes).This review is written from a solo play/""offline"" perspective.If you're a solo player however be aware that this game is all good at first but once you start getting into the mid to end game the monsters will have mechanics that would just destroy your run. From stun locks to monster mechanics that won't give you an opening to use an item or sharpen your weapon (will touch that in a bit) to some attacks/charges that even when you dodge will still hit you because the monster is simply too big and your roll is not. Weapon's sharpness/sharpening (more of a personal annoyance) You would think that in order for you to hunt monsters you would have a reliable weapon ohoho but you'd be wrong. It feels like your weapon's sharpness is non existent you're going to have to sharpen it mid fight because if you don't you loose dps and your attacks bounce off of your enemy so no damage. As I said this is more of something that personally annoys me and not something that would outright have you killed."
"""Just one more game...""Easy to learnEnjoy playing for 5 minutes or 5 hoursEthical microtransactionsGreat to play with friendsFun at all skill levelsRuns great on older PCsI find myself going back to this game every night. It's very addicting and worth trying."
80 percent of players are aggresive and want to kill you on sight. When you get to their level odds are you're just going to get raided and blown up.

My favorite game of all time.Singleplayer 10/10 The story is just perfect. The mods make it more perfect.Online 8/10 If you play online make sure you have a friend to play with. Hacking is becoming a serious problem.Overall 9/10 If you don't know whether to get it or not. Get it.
This game is very fun. There are so many laughs you can have with friends. Great game all around.
Awesom
This game is great and everything I have been hoping for since I preordered it about a month ago! 10/10 would recommend as a veteran monster hunter player. Hopefully will be more optimized as time goes on but I still would highly recommend this game to anyone who is new or returning to the series!
May have a ton of bugs but is still pretty good game
Easy to learn hard to master ridiculously easy to get addicted to.This is by far my favorite multiplayer game.Everyone has to try it!
If you want a laugh with friends rage at your friends and scream when you score in the last minute to win when you've been down 4 0 all game to comeback 5 4. Definitely recommendGreat amounts of customisation. Cheap DLC and runs smooth on low end PCS. Hard to master but that's the challenge of the game. Great competitive aspect and rewards.Who thought driving cars with rockets on and smashing a ball into a net would be so much fun? 10/10!
nice game D

With having been a HUGE fan of h1z1. I can honestly 100% say that this game blows it out of the water.I was nervous that I would get bored with this game quick after investing so much time in a game of the same exact style. But once I felt the shooting mechanics I immedietly realized what H1 was always missing... A GREAT DEVELOPER. Maybe one the best I have ever experienced with a game. Everything they say they will do... They do... Its not just releasing half of what they say for one big update every half a year and then have the game offline for 2 days. Daybreak ruined a great thing and they only have themselves to blame... They were money hungry with the paid content. When all they had to do was just deliver on fixing there game. This game has made the developers millions of dollars and will make millions more. H1Z1 is now dead in the water. With a scramble to start being a good developer its to little to late. Battle grounds is here.... And its here to stay. Jump in. Jump out of a plane. And get to looting folks! STOP READING AND JUST BUY IT!(as far as this being an early access title) It wont be for long. Maybe half year tops. Because that is what the developer said. And that is what the developer will do. Yes there is a hacker problem (apprently) I don't know if I have expereinced any in my 200 hours of game play. But GUESS WHAT. The developer will do everything they possibly can and they will fix it. They promised optomization first. And every update is a HUGE improvement. So when they decide to tackle the hackers.. IT WILL BE UPDATE AFTER UPDATE fixing the problem as well. Sorry H1.. you are done SON!

Rust is a survival game very much still in Alpha but from my perspective worth all the money. It is a very interesting game you get bored harder you die a little every time but it is more fun when playing with friends and honestly would need more optimized because with a decent computer go 30 fps.So if you want to play a survival and have fun with your friends buy Rust!
This game is fun and has potential but the devs have already broken thier promise. Asking us for more money even though thier game is not finshed. Now its $2.50 for a key soon to be Buy now and get a 4x scope at the beggining of every game. I hope this ing game burns down and looses everything so that we may set an example. Us gamers are not respected. Battlegorunds has sullied itself.
Good Game
Even with a very powerful PC this game runs terribly. Still has significant lag problems awful devs the list goes on. Steer clear.
102 hours just 2 weaks lol best game eu
I have a couple hours and so far its really fun to play 10/10 would recommend
Pros Sort of Dark Souls Gameplay you need to learn your enemies movements to improve Good customization and loot Freedom to change weapons at any point Beautiful scenarios and monsters As a biologist really liked the Ecology studies in the game Collecting plants bugs minerals etc. is really easy and fluidCons PC is always a big step behind from consoles (which is the reasons for most downvotes) Sort of repetitive track and kill monster loot improve track and kill bigger monster loot improveIf it fits your style it wont let you down its a damm good game
Very fun game just needs to have the DLC on PC version I'd say.
Not the best of reputations as a developer but this game keeps you coming back with a fork and knife for that chicken dinner. So as long as they update it and add more guns maps and vehicles this game will be a new CS GO. One of the best parts of this game is the randomness of it. The fact that you can ride a bike over a mountain through an upstairs window and kill a squad is absolutely insane. Definitely the best battle royale on the market currently.
Overall from the stories from GTA 5 offline I will score 8/10From GTA 5 Online you need a few friends to play together and it will be very fun if you play solo it will be very boring because sometimes you will meet some hackers who will disturb you wherever you go until they are satisfied.Good Game !
The singleplayer story like almost all of Rockstar's games is quite excellent. The multiplayer unlike almost all of Rockstar's games is not so much. Still fun but fairly p2w.
Swinging my pick over my shoulder sweat sticking to my neck I grab the last few pieces of stone needed for the upgrade from wood to stone.It had been a few long hard days to get to this point gathering wood stone and metal.However it will be worth it when I get back to be able to sleep at night without worrying someone might knock down the door.As I climbed the hill back towards my homestead the smell of thick black smoke filled the air and then I saw it.Rising from my house.The sound of hysterical laughter filled my ears as three men wearing make shift armour emerged from the burning corpse of my once loved home.I watched the house crumble to the ground unable to move unable to pay attention to anything else.Before I knew it a sharp agonising pain filled my body.A drop to my knees then fall into a thick puddle of crimson.As I lay there unable to hold the screams of pain in listening to the laughter of three men I watched as the colour slipped from my vision the last few remains of my hard work crumble to ashes in the flames of hatred and then... There was nothing.10/10 would watch my hopes and dreams burn again
best game eva
So fun
Amazing game The graphics are Incredible compared to xbox 360 I recommend this game to anyone who is debating on getting it even though they already have it for a diffrent console The controls are a little hard to learn aswell
dont get me wrong i love this game but the one thing icannot deal with is the dysync and lag and mostly because all the asian/japanese counrtys play on the OC severs and completely ruin the gameplay experiece when they have there own severs to play on why wreck it fur us aussys i get less lag playing on NA then i do OC and im from australia please make this game regien locked or youll just the game even more
im bad at fifa and im bad at driving games so this game is perfect for me
Product received for free. Parachuted in.As soon as my feet hit the ground some naked dude ran up and punched me 1 time in the head instant killing me. 10/10 would never play unreasonably melee balanced game again.
Game is still in a catastrophic state... the updates are like sometimes they make it better sometimes they make it worse... instead of fixing all problems there is more focus on new content... sometimes its impossible to say if they people are cheating or the game is that bad (bugs deathcam .....) they made so much money with this.... and there are so many problems left since early access (ticking rate with servers is in some countries much worse than in other games).............still too many problems left with this gameAnd wth why this twich streamer &amp %($ skins and clothes that is the most unnecessary thing this game needed!!!!!!
This will help you become a gangster to have more friends
I havent ever gotten too far into this game but when I manage to find time to play. its a good laugh.
Mods
Best game on the planet
it's alright i guess
adolf hitler likes
only game ill start over and repeat the same 2 day process before losing it all again on the third
Pretty good overall many good updates coming out each month. Solo is a chore so get some friends to play with you and prepare for the toxic community.
Do not buy movement is bad gun mechanics are bad aiming is poor. Nothing to like about this game. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Its gonna need a lot of fixing before it's actually playable by the masses.
highly recommended... just buy the game if it's on sale and don't even think twice )
Only negative think I ve run into is that in the totorial they only show the controls for freaking keyboard... And the options is no sudding help in regards to some key controls on the gamepad like how to DODGE with a gamepad eventhough I think it s quite important to know that .. Annoying!!Anyone that can help?Other then that I really enjoy this game quite alot )
Great game!!! The only problem is that its really addicting!!!
i enjoy this game on the off chance that my friend doesn't throw.
Very good game but honestly I prefer play minecraft hunger games
My game keeps crashing and idk what to do
i need healingYou have died outside of playzone.

Amazing
They just got rid of mods they can go get ed.
Fix the servers and DC's.Games aight.
It is amazingly awesomely fun. I recommend getting a controller it is hard to switch from keyboard to controller or vise versa . Get it.
Probably one of the best games i have ever owned! I recommend this game to anyone who likes to survive and build stuff. This is not a game! This is survival of the fittest! For this game follow your natural instinct as it guides you to victory! p.s and by victory i mean a successful raid!
"Best ""I wish we could do this in a private session"" sim out there.10/10"
For me as a PC and Switch player who can't get his hands on God of War and RDR2 this is the best Game 2018. It started with a clueless but hyped beginning and boy did it deliver. The monsters the weapons the music they alone make this game a masterpiece in which you can invest hundreds of hours and still want to keep on hunting.There where a few issues at the beginning of the release on PC but now it works perfectly fine and we should be grateful to got such a great port for this game.It brought me to the monster hunter franchise and made it one of my favorites right behind Dark Souls.So try it play it master it if you like big weapons epic fights and always want to get better this is your game!
Good Game
its ok i guess
Yeah it's pretty good.
The game crashed after I died where i would of lost a crystal and when i loaded back it was still therethe next game the lobby declared me a cheater. Please fix your detection system.edit So apparantly its not me thats the issue its everyoneEvery single lobby i connect to or invite i get it disconnects everyone saying that its cheatingwether its play as suvivor survive with friends be a killer and kill your friendsquick play included.Edit2 Lobbies are now working however everyone's ranks have been set back to 20
Pretty good.
I have completed the game to 100% I've got every possible item unlocked all tofus and got the best rankings in the game. My only advice is for people who are worried about not having enough content there is definitely enough to enjoy the game many many times. You cannot compare the scale of this to an online shooter or a sandbox RPG because it's nothing like those games. The value of this game is the same as when you play a story driven single player that you binge for a while and if you like it enough (like most fans) you'll go back to the game later simply because you love the game not because theres more to do. Anyone who says the game is too hard or the controls are difficult to master go play minecraft or get better( I died loads of times).
I love this game and where its going!
"My girlfriend mad at me because this game i literally ignored her all the time for this game. then i apologize and promise to give her more attention... tomorrow she mad to me again then she asked me to choose betwen GTAV or her. I said...Me ""Honey do you really want to me answer the question?""Her ""So? Me or that crap?""i slapped the out of her...Me ""NEVER TALK LIKE THAT TO MY FAVOURITE GAME !"""
Devs make improvements but leave much to be desired. There have been significant improvements from EA but for a fully released game for $30 it isn't completely worth it. The first few games will be fun but after a while playing the same map (2 maps now) it will get repetitive. Also at the time of this review the North American server is still FLOODED with individuals speaking Chinese. This is a team based game where communication is vital. I have not noticed hacking since it has been fully released but I do not doubt that it is still a present issue for others.
one of my fav games come back time and time again
I've been getting bored of the game but from what I've heard they're going to keep updating the game and adding content even after the game comes out of early access. There's also a new map coming soon so that will mix things up. The gameplay is good but this game really shines when you play with friends and that's really the only reason I still play it anymore. There are things that need to be worked on such as optimization and netcode but those things can be fixed.
PUBG NO1 !!
this game isn't worth your time or money will forever be a lag filled show the devs work at a snail pace cos they just don't give a ez money xD
I absolutely love this game .I recommend it to all of my friends IRL as I can . The building is phenomenal the map looks amazing there's endless amounts of things you can do from raiding to just trolling people . The main problem I see people have with this game is they say it's too toxic . What online pvp game isn't toxic . The only difference in rust is you're going to get taken advantage of as lose everything unlike other games where you can just carry on . It's very very hard at first there's so much to learn although it is a lot easier for noobs now no backwards walls harder to raid . Face punch is by far my favorite developers not only for the amazing game but also because they are working so hard to make it better every single week right on time with an update . I can't wait till Thursday to see what's new . If you aren't a and love survival games I suggest you buy this and become a pvp raiding clan killing legend .. If you are a and or don't like survival games I kindly suggest you off and go download league . It's free
Absoultely unplayable online services with nothing but 12 year old modders running around destorying your cars. CEO's randomly losing connection therefor failing any heists. We were even promised single player DLC but nope instead we got hundreds of new cars and colorful sh*t that led to online becoming trash.
Freddy is too OP.Do not buy if you want to deal with that.It is unbalanced. It is stupid. Until they change this I can't recommend it.
Product received for free. Good game
Becoming a rust owner you will recieve the following DLCs for free Rage Quit DLC Crushing Monitor DLC Kicking your head against a brick wall DLC Depression DLC Toxic DLC Salt DLC Ebola DLCBut if you play on a nice low populated lobby you should be just fine so I recommend it )
Game feels so good to play great game love it i came from dayz but it has a h1z1 and dayz feel combined worth it 100% all the way minor con it is in early access so there is server lag frequently but not to big.
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR (STEAM) I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET A GAME TO WORK FOR MY SON.. I HAVE EXPLAINED TO THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT THAT WE WOULD LIKE A REFUND..OR AT LEAST A TECH TO CALL ME AND SEE IF WE CAN RESOLVE THE ISSUE I HAVE SPENT OVER 3 HOURS TRYING TO INSTALL AND LAUNCH THIS GAME THROUGH MULTIPLE SERVERS AND NOTHING IS WORKING ALL YOU HEAR IS THE MUSIC IN THE BACK GROUND.. CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS SAYING I HAVE MORE THAN 2 HOURS OF PLAY TIME SO NO REFUND.. I KNOW IF THEY CAN SEE WE WERE LOGGED IN FOR 2 HOURS THEN THEY CAN SEE WE HAVE NOT ACTUALLY GOT INTO A GAME AT ALL SINCE PURCHASED... HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.. IF THIS IS NOT RESOLVED i WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANTHING FROM STEAM AGAIN.. THE GA GAME IS CALLED RUST..
My friends begged me for like 2months to get this game i didn't want it at first but then i liked it!once i bought this game i got vulcan streaght ahead i spent around 23hours on this game and its real fun even tho im not that much of a pro! I'm looking forward for more updates and features and im surely going to buy every single DLC car and im going to gift it to the friends that wants it this game is epic! 10/10 9/11 8/7
A very simple game with a very simple concept something that most modern day multiplayer games lack but Rocket League excels at. As a football (soccer) fan this game does incredibly well to capture the drama and emotion of the beautiful game. I've had games where my team was 4 0 down with 2 minutes left only to turn it around and win 5 4 with the last shot going in at the 05 mark. On the flip side we've conceded last second goals in ranked that left everyone questioning their existence. On top of this the developers have not dissapointed with the super cheap DLC! Which is of course optional and does not have any impact on gameplay if you choose not to purchase. The first flawless cross platform matchmaking I've seen. Take note EA some developers do care. This game brings about the same feelings I had for Super Mario Strikers back in the day. Just about as good as a simple multiplayer game can get. Play it with your friends and you're bound to have some laughs talk some trash and score some amazing goals.
soccer + cars best game ever
Great game well done port. Just wish it had 21 9 support that's my only complaint.
neato.
Garbage community play in a close server with friends or don't play at all. Fun with friends though! Seb would probable managed to be affraid.
Here is simply my one perspective This games is so wonderful. I sincerely can't wait to see what you guys bring us down the line. In the meantime.. I'm really enjoying this game. Thank you so much for investing your time and creativity into it.Praise be to he who lets us close the capsule door during sandstorms.
Such an amazing game )Really recommend it for sure!
good game!!!
Updates are always a disappointment.
Money grab t.
Only reason it was purchased was to have ownership of the game I own. Take 2 is dictating how I use my own game. This is t do not support or purchase this game.

Gret multiply game u have to learn much things if u want to be a great player
I think the best GTA is that one. Both online and singleplayer modes are really fun to play. Another good thing is that the developers keep updating the game. The only bad thing is there are too much cheaters in the multiplayer section.
I bought GTA V recently and enjoy it but Take 2's actions regarding modding have caused me to give a negitive reveiw.
First MH game ever to familiarise me with the series. It's niche but does have it's issues. However if you manage to look aside them the game is quite enjoyable although a tad small (from what I've heard).
With the recent desync fix the game is actually fun.
Pretty awesome game. What can you say it's Grand theft auto. High quality great universe good game mechanics. Physics were better and Grant theft auto four or at least more interesting. Grand theft auto online is amazing. Great customization. Really good game overall.
Man they really the bed on this game. Shake my head.
The Game itself is pretty good. Loot isnt rare so everyone gets a gun and nobody is underpowered.The Map is pretty big.The Servers are tho. I didnt had 1 Game yet that i could finish. Either its lagging out or you get disconnected completely.The Game is not running very well yet. Im on i7 4790k and 980Ti so my Setup shouldnt be too bad. My FPS are on 60FPS dipping down to 40 again and again. For me thats allright. But not everyone has such a good GPU.If you want a Game that works well dont buy this game YET. This Review will Change depending on how the Game runs in the future and how the Devs improve the game and the Servers.
nice game ))
one of the best early access games out their its pretty cheap and very fun 10/10

Monster Hunter World is both an entry point in the series for an audience who have only ever heard of the monter slaying slasher and a remake of the formula for an age old series that has fans of both the west and east joining together to explore the new world.As a long time fan of the series I was both excited and cautious of this instillation in the series due to its major change in both platform and gameplay. The open world aspect of each map seemed like both a dream and curse as I explored new rich environments and quickly learnt that the vastness could be my downfall in a fight. Although the new maps and world as a whole are a challenging change in mechanics and strategy the beauty of a small enclosed beach or a view over a vast lush forest can leave you lost for words during a difficult hunt.The veriety in weapons hasn't changed since the last title however the way that weapons are presented has changed considerably. Each weapon being in your box from the start like in every start to a MH Game but the practice area allows for in depth training that can make a world of difference when learning a new weapons style. As this is a new world that also means new monsters which will also lead to a new array of weapon and armor match ups all of which in the later game can be mixed to boost specififc stats and allow you to hunt to your full potential.The multiplayer is also heavily sold for hunts in both the story and in the Gathering hub for more advanced hunters allowing you to team up with friends or just friendly hunters to get through a hunt with ease. This doesn't however limit the solo experience as the difficulty level will increase with every added hunter leaving no solo hunter at a disadvantage to a monster should they choose to go it alone.In conclusion Monster Hunter World is a sensational step forward for the franchise showing advanced graphics on both console and PC and a system that can be sustained through teams or solo artists to achieve the very best results in a hunt. The game is gripping from A Z and although there can be some slow slopes to the story during investigation sections these all link to a greater mission that will prove to be a challenge to any capable hunter.10/10 would put far too much of my free time into this game again.

Days. Days of work ruined. Ruined by a Soviet leftover who prays to his rifle every night before sundown but not to sleep. He doesn't sleep. He plays RUST. He devotes his days to combing the countryside for new bases new fruit ripe for the picking. He's highly disciplined but clinically speaking only in all caps. His rationale is reduced to one word sentences with no punctuation. Your thousands of materials manifest in the toughest walls and doors are reduced to ashes in the face of 30 rockets that HE has meticulously crafted. A one man raid crew. All of your base are belong to him. He is Rust Player #39187 and he's a ing racist nazi bigoted who throws racial slurs around as only a basement dwelling 13 year old can. But tomorrow's a new day tomorrow's a new base.
Although it is in development it is one of my favorites games and the best survival game ever highly recommended ...!!
Well done like steak )

The best game ever. Και ειναι οτι καλητερο θα μπορουσα να εχω να μου κραταει συντροφια για τις κρυες νυχτες του χειμονα
Amazing game.
WHEN THEY GOT RID OF MODDING I SAW MORE MODDERS THAN EVER!!!
Buy it now its awesome to play with friends! Raid other people bases and build your self a fortress!
One of the best alpha games on steam in my opinion. Facepunch constantly keeps up with the updates and is adding more people to help with the rust project. My tip is tokeep up with the wipes and start on a server that wipes xp and map than start playing.
Fun game but to many modders (hackers) and the sessions always crashes you get stuck in various places. Everything seem bugged but this game is still worth playing. Especially when nothing goes wrong for an entire day (about once every 15 days)
Rocket League is an alright game. But when the developers take away one of the primary reasons to play video games the game suffers greatly. You see many people use games as an outlet for stress or to get away from their troubles and when the devs ban them for simply insulting another player you know something is up. This is an extreme overreaction and illogical way to handle the problem. I got a 24 hour ban for this reason that only started when I entered the game again. I got banned from a game for saying something insulting. Not muted. Banned. BANNED. REALLY DUDE. This makes no sence at all especially when the person getting insulted could just mute me. If you really did want to help you could add a filter on the chat that once a swear word or insulting word goes through it it asks the other team if they want to mute the other user. This would be toggleable obviously. I cannot back this game that bans people for insulting others. That is the most outragous strategy for removing toxic players. Such a wuss approch and I HATE IT. It blows me away how the devs thing that I deserve my 24 hour GAME ban. I deserve at CHAT ban at the very most. If they really cared just ban the player from chatting entirely after a few times. A game ban is too far.About the game itself The game suffers from what CS GO suffers from. You will see someone who on your screen obviously did not hit the ball hit the ball. That is because of the server tickrate. The fact that this is so noticable is truly unacceptable.
Good!
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THIS PROBLEM IS FIXED! I love the concept of this game. And it really pains me to do this but I'm going to have to give this a thumbs down. The game is beautiful. The rounds are pulse pounding and exciting. You find yourself jumping when a killer catches you off guard and you really get a feel for the immersion. The level up system is solid if a bit OP on the survivor side. The problem with this game and it's a big one is the fact that YOU WILL FREEZE UP. In every match. Always. I have frozen up temporarily in every single match I've played as the killer allowing the players to literally dance in front of me while they finish their generator repairs or looting. It's not a connection issue. It's a glitch that occurs when some loser quits a match early. Only the host a.k.a the killer is forced to lock up while the rest of the survivors go about their merry ways. I've lost rare one time use items and all of my points from being forced to quit a match just to end it. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! It should have been tested enough to work these problems out before launch. End of story no excuses. This is poor design and it harkens to the devs being too lazy to hammer out their product. I hope they fix this issue soon but I must recommend that nobody else buys this game without these bugs being fixed. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THIS PROBLEM IS FIXED!
65/5000 Desperate to survive is a real garbage game every update is the more updated card playing time is always carton real garbage game optimization is extremely poor. A lot of bad comments!!!!!!!!!
"&gt Do you have an IRL friend(s) who owns this too?Then it's a must have.&gt Do you play alone most of the time?Skip it.(I wish Steam had neutral ratings since this is as close to giving ""neutral"" as it gets.)"
The Single Player has loads of potential to get a good experience out of it. The best way to unlock is too use mods to make it a) better looking b) better to play and c) more enteraining. I have played loads of single player as I don't bother with online (450 hours) and I still love the game to this day it's truly astonishing!
Most fun game when teammates arent bad. Think it should win award cause good game. grammar and spelling XD
This game is great if u dont have alot of time or when u dont want to think to much.Its also a nice game to do with ur kids ( well i do they like it alot ) 10/10
The game would be alright. If you wouldn't be playing the desert map 95% of the time. Not to mention that most players are from china with no desire to communicate or that the server are utter or the absurd number of hackers or the hitreg...
Chances are if you're at all interested in GTA V then you've already got it so I'm not going to bother recommending you buy it. But there's also a decent chance that you own it but have only played the multiplayer. GTA Online is great but if that's all you've experienced then you're seriously missing out. The story mode of GTA V surprises me with how polished it is each time I play it. It's an incredibly well put together game and one that you really shouldn't miss out on playing.
&gt bought the game&gt 24 hour download&gt Doesn't launch&gt mfw 12 hours total (no jk) trying to find a fix&gt finally fix it&gt 40 hours in last two weeks 40 hours on record 10/10 would download and play again
I've spent 1200+ hours playing this game and unfortunately it is currently riddled with hackers. It has been atleast one per match the last week and I'm not sure I can continue much longer.I will continue to try and support and play the game without hacks but it is becoming very difficult. It seems to be a hacker vs hacker game for the most part now.I hope you can recover bluehole!
One of my top 5 all time games. Devs are active every week with quality updates. I've had it since it came out and still play it. It's worth it it you play with a group of friendsEDIT this games anti cheat is completely horrible and failed me i got banned for absolutley no reason and when i emailed EAC about it they said i broke the rules and cheated and will never be unbanned i dont not recommend this game to anyone do not buy it the anti cheat wasted 2.2k hours of my life and over 100$ in skins terrible game do not buy itEDIT I GOT UNBANNED THE GAMESGREAT EVERYONE BUY IT
Best developersNot the best communityBut still an all time favorite for me.
Current state of the game Survival of the Clanniest
Like every other other review says the campaign is 10/10.But that's only half the game. Online is a very fun with days of content and it's a great time with friends. Hackers are a problem but most of the time i'll just find a new session and avoid them. And a lot of the newer content is very expensive but you don't need to buy everything in the game just working for the stuff you want and it makes this a very rewarding game.
damn this game is great and has some serious potentail to be one of the best of all time for survival games
it's skyrim but with paid mods.
i had more fun in training as a lone player
Good gamplayGood animationGood detailBad netwaorkBad UI7.8/10
PUBG is popular because it fills a void in current games. Players are sick of being superheroes. We want to feel like we are overcoming the odds to defeat our foes. Killing dozens of enemies has gotten boring it lacks both personality and weight. PUBG gives meaningful weight to our choices and not just in a dialogue tree but within the gameplay itself.However I can't honestly recommend it right now because the game is filled with technical issues. Strange texture popping and lag spikes are annoying in many games but in PUBG it can cost you the round.
If you like playing with balls and multiple guys as much as I do you'll love this game!
IF u like chasing/tracking and sharpening this is for u.if u like fighting large monsters well u will spend no time doing that in this game. as they run as soon as u have done damge to them.also i feel the coop part of the game feels like it came from 2008
Take two decided to mess with the modding comunity to promote their cancerous GTA online.
whats a R0cket Lague? 10/10
Best GTA game in series! I bet it will be the best game on PC for years to come!I'm blown away with FPS mode superb graphics and attention to details!And multiplayer is like a new game very good and fun!Rockstar is constantly setting a bar higher with every game they made!
Nice game for a company of 4+ people
"The amount of fun I had on this game was insane yes there are a few people who ruin the experience in some matches by leaving early or just be a**holes but hey isn't that all online games?Pro tip nothing strikes fear into the heart of killers more than ""The Helicopter"" (picture a downed survivor spinning on the spot like a rotor blade)."
This is just for the Badge.
devs to put it shortly.How about those Mods eh?/Hah/.
The game might be a little twisted from the killers point of view but if you don't like to slash people's guts out of there body then just don't play killer! I have almost 200 hours now but half of those hours are afk hours but the 100 hours I have actually played i've enjoyed! So if you're looking to get this game I hoped I helped &gt
Best when play with your friends!!!
Product received for free. it is good game!!!!!!!game i like very!!yes!! game good!
GJ Take Two Interactive ... All modding used by OpenIV is for singleplayer use only to make the game more enjoyable the software OpenIV was never used to mod multiplayer or Grand Theft Auto Online so it does not harm anyone.Edit OpenIV is alive D
wasted my life 10/10
One of the best multiplayer games ever!The community and the servers are perfect!I love it and I'll never stop playing it!&lt 3
Product received for free. Funny game to play with friends. Some times buggy but had a blast most of the time I played it. I Dont play it anymore.
Fornite &gt Pubg WHY THE I'm BANNED
Overhyped and not worth $30USD at the moment IMO. I've requested and received a refund.Poorly optimised and a rinse repeat of jump out of a plane run here loot shoot people die....Gaming community thinks this is great? lol
"PUBG is another ""Real is Brown"" deathmatch shooter. 100 people last man standing wins.You jump out of a plane loot a house then get shot by someone you didn't see.OrYou jump out of a plane loot a house run from the electric wall of death for 15 minutes and then get shot by someone you didn't see. Assuming the death wall didn't kill you first.At $30 it's WAY overpriced. Extremely buggy very little customization only one large map crawling with cheaters impossible to figure out mechanics and everything comes down to who gets the best camping spot.Frustrating and not at all fun. Not sure why people love this game so much except that it's streamer bait.Edit Now with Microtransactions. &gt _&lt Edit 2 I requested a refund and was refused.Edit 3 The game has gone live and it is still just as bad as it was before but now all the weekly items are locked behind microtransactions. So congrats Bluehole for making this game suck even more than during EA."
spwan naked with a rock hiting tree nod make a tools continue hiting tree take hemp make clothing make bowhit drum ran bow fighting.. bandage... ran... 1 hit 2 hit serpentine... bleeding bandage... ran bow fighting againheadshot... wolf attck while looting screaming!!! another naked come finish me off!
Best game i have played to date would 10/10 recommend
Game is fun Until you go over the ping limit and it freezes your game. Some people cant get perfect internet. So for people who have bad internet with lag spikes it can cause you to lose. Just lost because the game froze me after ping went over the allowed amount and I died to the circle. It is a dumb idea for the game to freeze if your ping goes to high. Would be such an awesome game if it didnt have this feature coming from someone who has bad internet
Easy to play so hard to master
Don't really like the story in this game it is just not that interesting to me. I can't really sympathize with the character like I could in GTA IV. Not to mention the whole several playable characters thing just isn't something I really like either I preferred it where you just played as one person rather than several.
10/10 would miss the ball again
Product received for free. Awesome game with developers that care about the game and their community more then just making money of off their playerbase. Keep it up!
great game for being in beta or alpha whatever its in and they are making great progress on making it even better
The name of the game should be changed to GRIEF. The only ones who get ahead are those who run around killing other players and looting everyone else's belongings. Even a single griefer on the server can ruin the game for everyone else. I tried for hours to get a simple shack built only to be repeatedly killed by the same tool with advanced weapons over and over again. There are no safe zones so forget hiding in your shack or running away. You're on a timer to get food or you die quickly. So the only option for casual players is to die by starvation or die by getting a bullet in the head from someone you can't even see. Want to set up a clan or a village? Forget it. If you manage to overcome the massive paranoia this game instills and form an alliance with someone you still have to constantly watch them because hey they get close to you and wait until you have tons of stuff before they shoot you in the back. This isn't just my experience on one server either it's several. TBH the only time this game was any fun was when I was the ONLY ONE ON THE SERVER! Until this game develops some safeguards for friendly players it will be DOA. Sad because it's got potential otherwise.
Just bought it already LOVE it!
קררראוראוו
"Honestly this game must host some of the clunkiest combat I have witnessed. You cant jump unless you sprint towards a cliff or unless you use a certain weapon type and even then it is ridiculously hard to control your character when in the air. I have lost count at the amount of times they just flail around and miss the enemy. This brings us to another major issue of this game the lock on system. Most of the enemies in the game will have ""weak spots"" on their bodies but you can only lock on to 2 parts the body and the head. This makes it really hard to hit the weakspots or even the enemy alot of the time because your character will just kind of attack in a direction and when using dual blades for example will fly right by the enemy not even hitting it. It is quite comedic at how bad the combat is. Often times when fighting the larger monsters another larger monster will come around and join the fight. To change the enemy you are locked onto you have to cycle through all the targets in the area swaying the camera around most likely ending with you being cheap shotted and at higher levels this could end up with you being on shotted. Furthermore I like the idea of enemies fighting one another but it is so poorly implemented in this game that they attack eachother maybe once then they will turn and beeline it for the player characters. To add onto this there is no blood or healthbar for enemies so you will be fighting monsters until you can visibly see them limp when they run away which seems like it can take and eternity. Even when they are limping it still takes quite some time to actually finish them off. This seems like a major missed opportunity to actually have the enemies show blood cuts and bruises to signify the health they have left. Even if the gore was an option in the menu it would have been a welcome addition.The ""hunting"" in this game is honestly the most monotonous part. You fight a monster it runs away you chase after it you fight it it runs away you chase after it rinse and repeat. This can occur maybe like 6 12 times for a single monster. It may seem refreshing at first but after the first 10 hours it gets annoying and fairly rage inducing especially because that is a good portion of the ""gameplay"". And honestly it could be forgivable if the combat wasn't so terrible.Also a good portion of the enemies you fight in this game can become airborne meaning if you have a melee weapon (which I assume alot of the playerbase will) you either have to wait for it to land or get a few lucky hits on its feet as it hovers just above your head. This just adds to the monotony and could have been fixed if you were able to equip a ranged weapon as well as a melee weapon OR even easier be able to jump without having a cliff nearby... or even better both?The progression in this game is entirely hit and miss as well. You grind for hours on end to get better armor and weapons (in a pretty impressive technology tree) but you never actually feel like you can kill monsters faster more efficiently or take less damage from them. You get to a certain point in the game where you may start to feel progression and then the enemies get alot harder dropping better materials to further farm but basically kill you in one or two hits. You have to farm for better armor to not get one shotted but the enemies you have to farm are the culprits of this unfair challenge. It honestly all just feels like artificial challenge especially with how awful the hitboxes are as well. There were countless times playing this game where I visibly was beside underneath or behind the enemy when they attacked and even though there was no physical way I could have gotten hit I indeed lost health and most likely got stunned leaving me open to another attack. It's kind of funny how the same company that made this game also made Dragon's Dogma which featured better controls and in my honest opinion significantly better combat. You can jump and grapple enemies regardless of the weapon you have equipped and you can dodge out of an attack providing much more responsive combat in a game released years before this one. The game got fairly monotonous as the hours started to add up and honestly a good portion of the ""difficulty"" I encountered felt artificial due to the gameplay mechanics. If the combat was ironed out and the hitboxes fixed the game would honestly be pretty fun. But as of right now if you're feeling like wasting your time to chase monsters countless times each ""hunt"" for 15+ minutes over and over again with some pretty rage inducing combat this game may be for you."
This game is so much fun! After you start playing it's hard to stop.Also it's very easy to learn but certainly hard to master!I recommend this game for everyone.Just buy the game already! D
I've made this review only for the Autumn sale badge. Btw the game is good.
What can i say i luuuv this game. Its awesome and totaly a game everyone should have in their library
The game is not finnished. I get some stuttering I get ocasional crashes I get weird bugs and sometimes my car hovers in the air like it's from another world. However I havent gotten this wrapped up in a game this fast since I was young. This has everything I've always wanted. Massive map customizable weapons and a huge group of players. This game gives you the most tangible feeling of anxiey and fear. Even pros will sometimes find that they die almost instantly. Its great. As long as the improvements keep coming I reccomend this game.Edit RIP this game
doesnt even launch anymore.cant even get my free dolly clothes.
There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said. GTA V will go down in history as one of the most amazing and played games of all time.
Product received for free. dis game is super good
please fix all cheat
AMAZING.. Scrub with full auto sub opened his door and got 1 pieced with my 45 pistol... 10/10 Would do it all again
Bring back mods
Amazing gameplay only issue I have is disconnecting but that is currently being worked on. The company has also stated more graphics options are going to be added soon.

You can see cheating players at everywhere in this game. Even in a wild toilet youcan meet a LYB.
Seriously scroll though and look at the hours played for everyone who down voted this game.I think its crazy to down vote a $30 game that you've played for over 100 hours and some of these guys have closer to 500 hours.I mean its not without its faults but honestly some people just love to be salty
10/10 best car physics in gaming history

RagequitNew serverRepeat the above but with a wolf instead of a bear.Would I recomend this game? Yes. but don't get attached to any items in game whatsoever. It will be taken/lost ) Not suitable for children."
Tons of issues with this game right now. #1 Issue is network connection. Although this was present in the console version it's even worse here. Some sound files get glitched and just continue to play through out the quest. There's a horrible screen tear at the bottom that sticks for a moment if you get out of the menu too quickly. This game is simplfied from the previous Monster Hunter games to get new players into the series (I find this okay however if you're looking for G Rank and more challenge. Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate is coming soon.) Good things to note Looks gorgeous Runs at 1080p60fps or better with a decent PC Lots of fun I personally love this game but if someone was on the fence about this game... I would wait for a sale unless these issues get fixed. In the meantime I suppose I'll enjoy solo hunting. Once I've given this a few hundred hours of gametime I'll update this review for the integrity of the game.
playeble only on high end performance is very bad
Game is very fun but players are very toxic.
Great game but way to many hackers anti cheat systems need to better prevent this kind of thing because its destroying the fun.
Honestly rock star has been going in the wrong direction for a while. Now that they've banned modding GTA V has almost no nothing going for it as a single player game. Just another Same y monotonous sequal in a long line of cash grabs. Do not buy for more than $10.
No ing way Take Two.
I hopped on the bandwagon and I cant get off
the game is good in my oppinion but i ALWAYS have issues with the game getting corrupted or just not launching or loading and for that reason i dont think this game worth it
this game gets a all around 10/10!it tops every battle royal game ever made!! no other can come close to PubG!
Product received for free. Rubberbanding since day 1 of early access.DO NOT BUY
GREAT FU*KING GAME go to the coast get together have some laughs kill some
this game is great.
this game is absolute trash xD
Very fun. Considering you like to play hide and seek and you're not a sore loser... )
Guys you all are rating a game badly because you downloaded a mod that the developers said you cant download. Its like me putting a roach on ice cream then blaming the ice cream maker. its stupid.
veri nais ( ʖ )
Lag gets a bit annoying but chasing that win (AKA Chicken Dinner) is all
great game and gets better with each update !!
20/10 had this on xbox liked it that much i got it on pc regret nothing
This game is crazy fun and super Intense.
Loved this game. Then people starting shooting me through walls and mountains (wallhecks). Yes mountains. As in the new desert map mountains. Not one of those mountains that you can third person peek over a mountain probably bigger than the state of Texas. I am getting tired of a dude on the back of a dune buggy driving around holding the trigger on a UMP (insult to injury) and the bullets travel through the mountain and nail me in the head. I wasn't even on his mini map for pete's sake. Unless this gets fixed I highly recommend NOT playing this game because it completely ruined game night with my friends and I rarely get the chance to play with mine due to our schedules. I'd tell you not to buy it but at this point you probably already have back when the hype was real. Please fix this developers! I've dumped to much of my life into this game and I get massacred by someone who clearly isn't even North American (with the open mic he runs around with and spews gibberish). M A K E P U B G G R E A T A A G A I N
Good Game If You Get Mad Easy. Very Calming
It goot is
This Game is Amazing. I put it off for about a week because mass effect came out but then i finally picked it up. The game is early access i knew that coming in. It runs very rough and could use some optimization but the Gameplay is the best experince ive had in years. My heart cant stop racing every match i play. Either im raging for getting killed in the first 60 seconds or screaming got you son tryna sneak up on me. This game being so early i only see better things to come. I get about 50 fps on my 280x on low setting but still do able. Cant wait to see how this looks when i get my Vega card )
I just realized i haven't reviewed this game yet. So here it goes This game is a masterpiece. Pure and simple.
Winner winner chicken dinner!
Most updated game I ve ever played. The developers are very down to earth and updates are weekly and they all always add something to the game. The gameplay is the most realistic gun game ever. The scenery is beautiful even on the worst possible settings. The only negative is the community and how difficult this game is. You will tilt playing this game because it s very hard to get moving on but servers.
One of a kind genre. Think of it like you're experiencing the first of action shooters.
HOW DO UNLINK MY ROCKSTAR ACOUNT
the game is very fun but it is very tough on vanilla server except if your with a group over all the game is amazing
I like the game even if I am not good at it. It has a competitive mode and this is what I don t like cuz soon the community of this game will be as the csgo community but for now it is very nice
10/10 would get floored by a shotgun again
Awesome Game love it
NEVER EVER LAND FAR AWAY WITH YOUR TEAMMATE! SCHOOL IS WARMUP. 3rd PERSON is gay.
this game is awesome. first played last man standing and when i got pubg it felt so much better to play. the graphics are decent. fun alone but even more with freinds.
pretty validsoundtrack gives me a headache though
Noice gaem.
much fun with squad
First time I bought a game in early access but this is the most addicting game I played alone and friends. every round is really unpredictable and you always need to be in your toes. Devs does deliver their updates and so far optimization is improving! looking forward on this game getting better. devs are promising content and I hope they look at getting cheaters banned.
Game wont even open asked for a refund. Seemed fun though.
can ye tell me why its not woring i have lots of memory but its still not working
This game is the best purchase anyone will ever make in their life.
1/10 would never play online again.story mode definetly for moddingOk I got like a month ban THEN AFTER THAT A DAY OF DOING NOTHING AND REMOVING ALL MODS..BOOP PERMA BAN B
Amazing game. Can't stop playing it. So much to do.
nice
good game
I've withheld judgement on Grand Theft Auto V for the most of my gameplay because it's been a rollercoaster for me. Now that I'm basically done with the game I think it's time for me to leave a review. I will be reviewing the Online portion not the story. The story is fantastic and fun to play and I highly recommend you play it if you purchase Grand Theft Auto V. If I'm correct I've played GTA O over the course of three years which have mostly been a delight. I will cherish the memories I have made playing this game with my friends which were fantastic.However most of these memories came from the first few hours of the game. The game is only REALLY fun for the first few levels around up to 40 50 I'd say. The game allows you to explore and learn the game along with immersing yourself into the fictional Los Santos which is quite a large map and a fun adventure. For the first &lt 100 hours the game is truly a new and unique experience.Once you learn all there is to the game however it quickly loses its value. The game becomes not about having fun but earning more money to buy things that allow you to have fun. The heists are monotonous and provide too little compensation for a tedious setup. The MC Clubs / Offices / Bunkers require constant maintenance and need you to consistently work on them every second you get and there's always a risk of it being taken out by griefers who fly by in their Hydras and fire a storm of explosions. The hangars are a joke. The Doomsday Heist is only fun the first time through. The jobs don't pay. The races need expensive cars that cost you 3 000 000 in upgrades.The game obviously doesn't let you earn money as fast as you should be able to. This is to advocate the purchasing of Shark Cards a microtransaction which lets you instantly gain millions of ingame cash. But it doesn't end there. The Shark Cards are heavily overpriced with $100USD netting you a mere 8 000 000 dollars ingame. That's a joke! You can barely afford the most expensive office in the game or buy two/three of most expensive cars. You can't even buy the most expensive item which is a 10 000 000 dollar jet covered in gold paint the normal variant of which is merely a million dollars. You cannot possibly hope to gain any form of actual worth out of these microtransactions which means that it inherently is built to make you buy more and more sinking cash into a scam.Me and my friend beat the system. We've earned millions and millions of money ingame. But now that we've spent all that money on the cool things there's nothing to do. There's nothing rewarding about being rich. You play with your toys then you quickly realise you're just doing the same thing over and over again. I've spent the last 200 hours of my GTA O experience flying around in a jet shooting down anyone who shoots at me. Sure the expansions are fun and I come on each time one comes out but that's only to try them. Once I'm out of money I'm either going to hack it in or just quit the game because it's not worth the grind. Grand Theft Auto Online gave me a great experience. I will always love jumping out of helicopters with my friend to assassinate someone with a bounty and then calling in a car to make a quick escape. But I can't do that anymore. Now it's just rolling up in an APC and blowing them to kingdom come with an automatic missile launcher. Or it's bombing the hell out of them with a rocket powered plane. Or it's strafing them with explosive bullets out of a jet. It's not fun anymore.Except for the stunt races. Those are cool.
Fun game
Game hat
.
You know a game is good when it's the last thing you think about at night and the first thing you want to do in the morning.Rocket League made me forget to masturbate.
If you preordered this game you got ed in the . After getting I started playing GTAV ONLINE PC because that's what this version is called *facepalm*. There are so many menus and loading screens that I actually became a smoker just while I played this game. The AI is so incredibly stupid it makes you want to just stop breathing. Every single online lobby you get into will have modders however if you attempt to even the playing field you will get banned either permanently or for months. Every 3 days single player stops functioning for about 3 days so if you don't want to play with modders online then you can only play half of every week because of the extremely EXTREMELY stupid patching system. They make their own game unplayable every week. Makes me incredibly sick to my stomach that I spent money on these clowns. Don't buy this game don't play this game. Don't talk about this game don't stream this game don't pull up a vod. GTAV came out a long time ago and the rerelease is an abomination.
Bu zamana kadar yapılmış en iyi GTA oyunu!
low tick rate servers. constant crashes after 1.0. hackers still everywhere. no region lock for the chinese. your dev team is awful and cares little about fixing the game and only cares about adding content which will cause more problems. no matter what i say it wont change anything either because this tumor continues to grow by the millions. im still going to play but it will never be the game i always wished it would become. absolutely terrible developers
Love this game
Wow!What a save!Wow!Calculated.
UnBEARable.
I have completed the original 1998 game a few days before this came out but the wait since the E3 announcement was worth it. Resident Evil 2 met beyond my expectations for a remake as it is truly a game worth having. The addition of having new puzzles being on the edge especially with the Tyrant walking around it is an awesomely fun game!
The game is lots of fun... when it runs but it freezes more than an industrial grade freezer I have at this time 14 hours played and 40+ crashes and freezes. About 30 of them are from multiplayer but i paid $70 ing dollars for this game and I expect it to work. The game is looks great the cars are still made of helium and first person mode gives me a headache. Untill these crashing issues are fix I would not recommend getting.
It's a great concept
I prefered the 2003 release
pretty good and decent MHW serie already play 200hrsJust hate arena for farming Coin. Why do i need to use other weapon that i never practice why Capcom force people to do this?
Best Civ so far and it looks gorgeous.
really fun game would definitely recommend it it can be tilting to play sometimes but the concept is outstanding there is some glitches but its not tthat bad the upgrade system is so unique and the perks are also great. there is also constant updates and events so it almost never gets old. tho its a bit annoying that you need to buy dlc's to get some of the killers and survivors but its not a must to have all the dlc's.
This Game is Good and I Recommend it!
Very very spicey memey game and love it i recommend u get this game is spicymems
10/10. Best game ever. Very fun with friends.
Way to kill an amazing game Take Two.
Overall this game is very fun super adictive and when you loose or win it just makes you want to play more10/10
Enjoyable if you wanna play solo don't buy it its better with friends
This game is incredible there is no need for a review 10/10Legend
Can't really say much as i just bought it yesterday. But from the one game i have played (which by no suprise i lost but i scored 3 goals!) i think this game is amazing and worth the money!
It's football with cars that are rocket powered.What else do I need to say here?
Awesome game worth buying
The game good. Thats only i want to give good review...gameplay holy ing crap stupid op like . Why? First is the killer...pay to win...really? Perks like ing Jesus while survivors like you dev...human...frail and useless. Matchmaking wow like a sheep put into tigers den. Players wow in every ing games there will be michael myers. And always win...wow...not recommended. If this game can be refunded i would refund it again to buy other games than this
Extremly fun game worth the 27 quid dev team seem to be updating the game regulary few issues still need to be squashed but the game is solid see you in the game cadets
sorry i dont speak italian
Spent two weeks (my time) on rust getting to a gun...the dying because the only animals are incredibly terrifyingManaged to find a guy to help me and we got up to guns and a houseWe were walking around when he makes a smartass remark to a guy with a pipe shotgunWe both dieNever refound friendHad to start over
Great game many things to do. Some things dont work some things do. Has given me many hours of entertainment.
The most inconsistent game I have ever played. Shoot a guy with a shotgun up close he'll turn around around pop you once with a pistol and kill you.
buggy but fun. wish it was less camping based
Great game requires a bit of a beefy computer to run well with good fps etc. But besides that it is a 10/10.
And now this game is totally like the free mobile f*u*c*king game
I was waiting for this game to go on some sort of sale but I just had to buy it because it looked really cool. I have to say after 60 hours it's a game where you start out and you're still compared to other people but the room for improvement means I could be playing this game for a while. Oh yeah and the developers seem really cool and they like to interact with the community a lot.
Good luck making friends in this game everyone you see will kill u with no hesitation. still really fun game to grind and play with friends. Toxic community is the only down side and getting gang by 20 people can leave you pretty mad. if you can see past this tho i would recomend rust
ok so yeah
Like a dating simulator except each game is like a first date but destined to end terribly.10/10 would rage quit after team speaks enough english to yell China #1 again.
GOAT
Great game. Hoping the Devs stay active ) Would reccomend
very good very entertainmening
Toatally worth the price. Don't touch the game RockStar it works.
The servers were fixed. The game runs pretty well on minimum specs and anyone still complaining just haven t turned off Volume Rendering Quality which is the fps killer.General info Monster Hunter World is the fifth game in the series not including the g rank versions or spin offs of the other games where you hunt well Monsters and take their skin and wear it with a continuing cycle until you rage quit or you re done.Gameplay The gameplay is good and enjoyable like in the previous titles. With multiple weapons the game offers multiple game styles for all kind of players like the long sword for weebs dual blades for no skill people hammer for people that want to play whack a mole greatsword for THATS A LOT OF DAMAGE and the best weapon THE SWORD AND SHIELD THAT CAN BASICALLY DO EVERYTHING WITH NO PROBLEMS etc. Then comes armor skills that have multiple gamestyle changing abilities like wide range makes you a support making you able to use your own items that would normally only heal and buff you to buff and heal your team mates but the skills come into play in High rank and are really important to either make the monster you re fighting easier or to make a set to rek with the greatsword.Story The story is really meh as in I liked Monster hunter 4 Ultimate s a lot more for having an enjoyable cast of character with personality other than Look at me I curious about everything and I do nothing else useful than give you quests and try to kill myself in every cutscene in the game forcing you to fight the monster I almost got killed by or kill you in the process.Some things for newbies This game is the easiest in the series by far with multiple quality of life changes and other improvements like gathering is a LOT faster than in previous games and other changes that make the game less grindy and easier which makes this the most newbie friendly from the seriesFew gripes I just have a few gripes with the game like how there isn t G Rank or how I get poisoned by Rathalos more than Pukei Pukei and how I hate the puffball.End thoughts The game is good but it has a few problems that can mostly be ignored so buy it on sale but if you want the game right now I d say buy it somewhere else for cheaper.
Most of my hours are logging into the game /Still logging in...
99% mechanical skill1% game sense
Not that keen on solo mode but duo and squad mode are so good with friends. Amazing!
So far I am enjoying this game Online is definately the highlight.
its so good the preformance problems are now goneand its getting better by the moment
Interesting and competitive game!
Good gameSh*t serversUpdates that dont satisfy (1 5gb update 3 8 bug fix)Liar Devs
Game is great but hard to master
Awesome game
True Art
on low graphics all of my sights are very blurry and not good for playing please fix
Just lost 3 pips after a game disconnected. Please explain.
Great Game
Dont buy this trash game.
Ever since the new update I constantly have frame lag and my character keeps on glitching back a few paces.
gud game
Those annoying bugs in online is merduring this game
In my opinion the best and most true Resident Evil game to date. It's scary has good atmosphere good controls constantly surprises you and plays like butter peep the slow cutter.9/10 buy it only the b scenario is to samey to the first run through.
Not bad match making is terrible like any pvp games. Not sure why i'm matched against some seasonal champions.
Fun game to play Every month
"This game rocks. It totally does. If you watched gameplay from this game and thought ""hey this kinda looks fun!"" you literally HAVE to try it it's like a bajillion times better than you think it can be."
Product received for free. It's fun
"Chujowa gra.Nie polecam . Dlugo sie laduje to postanowilem ze dolacze na serwer trwa to jakies 5min+ to poszedlem cos zrobic przychodze nie bylo mnie jakies 6min.Patrze a tu ""disconnected time out"".Nie polecam"
OMG! Buttwhole company is so amazing.. They have made that much money by selling junk and rubbish... Please guys teach me how you do this so that I can a make a game like that and make that money by just sitting down and selling junk. Those weapon skins are really amazing.. Just ing change the colour of it without even putting any design on it and sell it for hundred of dollars lol.. so amazing
Port done right.
This the best game to play with friends.It seems you will be playin it just for fun but man when you get into this game it becomes your nightmare...lol
need a clan
Mods are banned on a PC game... what a shame.
To be honest this game is really boring in general
Rocket LeagueSimple but hard to master. Very addicting and a gameplay you cant see in any other game. The only downside to this game is the playerbase that can be awful some days. But there are games with a way worse community. 8/10 for Rocket League
i love this game but there's only like two or three maps please make more and dont be afraid of a little diversity
Product received for free. i dont know lol fortnite is better
game hay hihihih
This game is a really great game. Full of suprises.
After the update the ASIAN players meet all the Chinese hackers ?! How can I play games with hackers? I do not know what the publisher was thinking when not let gamers choose their sever! Out of real life the world has hated China enough and now in the game too. If any Chinese person can read these words you should feel ashamed of yourself. And to the game publisher thanks to this latest update I have had enough reason to quit playing this game.
I can t even load gta online I know my laptop isn t good so that is probably why but at least I have the game for the future but is their any low settings as I can only see normal and surely their is a low settings
All Rockstar and Take Two care about is earning money from Shark Cards used to have a lot of respect for Rockstar as a company for all the fantastic games they've made but now it's a greedy corporation I'm In full support of the OpenIV team
A good example of an old game being re done in a great way. Love it and love the First Person so much really does it for me.
it's k
This game is wicked once u learn the basics ur set on the greatest adventure ever ) just keep a look out for raiders and bandits gd luck
it's alright
"Better than that other ""league"" game kappa"

Take my review for the autumn sale!
Great game fun to raid people. Still needs to be worked on though so expect some glitches.
Do not buy this game! The servers are a piece of I was 6. and i got network lag when i was stalking an enemy. Guess what happened? I was stuck for 10s and he turned around and killed me. Wait for it to release by then they MIGHT fix the servers. Otherwhise the game is really fun but the network lag ruins it for me.
Game 'released' from early access. Plauged by more lag issues than before particlarly on the new Miramar map. Which is made even more annoying by being thrown into games on the new map 5x more often than the old map. Great game to play if you can actually play it but server connection issues are abhorrent. Also the new fancy party screen takes 3x longer to load into than the previous one after exiting a game. The grass and car are pretty but I dont want to spend a minute staring at it before the game connects to the server.Calling this anything but early access is a sham. The game still has a long way to go in terms of netcode and optimisation ebfore being deemed a full release. It was simply released so they could say it was and stop people complaining about hgow long it would otherwise have taken.
After several amazing years of modding it is cruel and entirely unecesary to take it all away like this. There was little to no research done on Take 2's end when they sent the cease and decist letter. I hope Take2 learn from this monumental mistake and backpedal moving on as a smart company.
Toxic and boring
the whole game is greatbut in online mode there are alot of hackers that what make game sucks rockstar you should fix your session and put easy way to report these kids.
lol how many of the negitive reviews have 100+ hours played
best game 2015 10/2
It's simply good!!!
Awesome game with lot of fun
The game is just awesome! I've finished it campaign and all what I can say is it's pure awesomeness! Starting Online soon..
Definitely worth the price!
Take Two
"The game is what I wanted KOTK to be. Hit reg is already head and shoulders above KOTK and it is far less arcadey and random than it and already has spectate after death on teammates. Unless something drastic and unfortunate happens this is the BR I have been looking for. There is slight lag randomly but Playerunknown has already laid out his plans on fixing any smoothness issues.EDIT Never mind. Want to be killed by hackers 24/7? Play this. Can't region lock China though because ""muh exclusion""."
It's funny that the month I finally sit down and go Ya know... I think it's about time I get to modding in LSFPDR and trying to police the chaos that is GTAV... of course they go and squash modding. Good Fight in local I'mma just off back to nullsec.
now the free expansions are nice but banning mods first for online and now for singleplayer is mad. they just try to squeeze as much money out of players by making the already expensive game hard to grind in online forcing people to buy shark cards.and now they force people to play more online by basically making the singleplayer boring after completing the story mode.they probably did not expect this backlash.
Best game and music
Rocket powered vehicles try to score goals and win matches. Doesn't get any simpler than that (Seriously it's an awesome sports/arcade game which is a lot of fun especially playing with friends).

Fun Game! Recommend it for all car and soccer players
Product received for free. 3 spoppy 5 me
great jagras eated my
The game is good but dont play online unless your ready to either get destroyed or spend money.
It got football and cars its perfect!The game got nice gameplay where teamwork (If not 1v1) is key. You learn to control your car better and better both on the ground and in the air while you play. You can play 1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4 and other game modes after your choosing and if you feel like taking on the big boys you can play ranked.The skills you use in this game is 1) Controlling your car2) Controlling the ball3) Predicting your opponent's next move4) TEAMPLAYI love the car customization and how it lets you make the car yours with different cars to choose from colors materials patters wheels boosts and more. A nice game and definitely worth buying if you like teamplay football and cars.

Product received for free. Best games to play with friends!
banned several times for just being on the same server as someone whos modding. won't buy a rockstar games ever again. rockstar should understand that banning people permanently in a game that costs 60 dollars is an unacceptable reaction to people using dumb mods. oh well.
This is high quality edge of your seat fast paced fun.I have always been a competitive gamer and this game is one of the best. Each game has the potential to be the l negative 5 minutes of your life and I love every moment of the eternity that is a close game.
I like it
Fun game but its so poorly optimized and weapons are broken asf sometimes u can kill them in 2 shots and sometimes with the same guns and them having same armour and health u can shoot like 10 bullets into them and they dont die!
Imagine life on earth but with no laws
"Rust is my all time favorite game. It brings me the most joy adrenaline and stress of anything I've ever played. The ability to succeed is based on experience skill and trust. It is the ultimate PvP experience and with the way the team over at Facepunch rolls out updates it's only uphill from here.Experience allows you to know which walls to hit with C4 how to sleep in that bush while you have the Airdrop on you and how to build a near impenetrable base. Skill is used to wield various weapons and know your limits when matching up against people. Can you kill those 4 nakeds chasing after you with only a spear and a hatchet on you? That's your call. Trust lies in the people you surround yourself with. Rust is an almost completely unpredictable game because you have no idea how people are going to react to the way you play. Killing that silly naked who wanted some food for free may have seemed like a hilarious idea at the time but maybe not so much when he shows up with 20 friends in full gear to your front door. And allowing that guy access to your whole base after you've only known him for 2 hours? I can tell you from experience it's not fun to log on and find that your base is no longer yours. They let me know that loud and clear as they screamed at me over their mics )Be friendly or be mean it's your call either way you have the ability to succeed immensely or end up homeless.PROTIPS Throwing spears are op AK is best gun pipeshotty is best gun for the poor don't build next to a spawn find some friends don't be too friendly don't eff with a clan unless you can back it up wall off your toolcupboard have an ""airlock"" in your front entrance pillars are 100% worth sharing sleeping bags saves 2 hours trying to find your friend if you wear clothes you will get shot 90% of the time if you're naked you will get shot 50% of the time everyone can hear you c4 people saying ""friendly"" almost never are nakeds aren't always what they appear to be hv ammo isn't worth the gp building on rocks makes for easy defense ladders really don't cost that much don't keep all your loot in one place keep up to date on glitches craft on the run have a ton of sleeping bags you can never have too many doors you can smelt/cook 4 items at a time don't plan your house too big salvaged tools are bad burst fire your gun deers come installed with vtec don't trust beancan grenades explosives can blow up the chests inside geared doesn't mean good or smart follow these tips and I'll still kill you )TL DR Best $20 I've ever spent."
RockeT League Ice Hockey ohhh yeah. Perma E Brake is the realz!!! Pullin Tricks out the Hat since 2017!
It's ok I guess
damn son thats some mighty fine microtransactions XD.
I'm not even going into detail about the general gameplay.When you finnaly get a hang of the game and kill a invader he suddenly revives himself runs a few steps and then despawns himself ...it becomes apparent that once you can't get outplayed you'll get hacked instead.Stay away from this game.
Very Nice
The game is ok. There are a few bugs but for the most part it runs fine. The loading screen for the map is a bit annoying though. I am able to it on a laptop.
KILL EVERYONE
great game
EXCELLENT!
Probably my favourite game that I have at the moment. It takes a while to get used to making arial shots or saves but once you get the hang of it playing ranked is heaps of fun. Ranking up isn't to hard if you're playing with friends that also know how to play as repetitive wins faster ranking up.
Candle Hats 10/10
"The singleplayer content is excellent. There's a reason after 2 years I find myself going back and spending hours there with no regret. The multiplayer doe? Just avoid itIf you want some of the multiplayer functions look for ""MP cars in SP"" mods. Trust me it's a shame they hidden a lot of cool weaponised vehicles (yes there are a lot of weaponised vehicles including another tank) and you can even summon bodyguards drivers and more. Basically you get 70% of the GTA online fun without hackers or rockstar mods or really any intervention."
Great game if you want to spend hours building a base only for it to be destroyed by a bunch of naked guys with wolf heads
Copied cuphead
I want to mod this game period.
Love this game. I bought it when I gave up on DayZ Standalone. I run 2 modded Rust servers. Raiding is exciting meeting people is always cool. Weekly updates and new items added all the time. Love the building aspect of the game. Good work. That was my review about a year ago. I've stopped playing Rust after they started adding all these AI and tanks mini games work benches and componets. Game has lost itself. My favorite time in Rust was during the BP system and the only AI was the attack heli. You don't feel alone anymore there is AI scientist everywhere when trying to loot the attack heli the CH47 event a tank patroling a Rad town. I just don't find it fun anymore. I've shut down both my servers. Been playing Arma 2 DayZ again. Yeet
downloaded the game played for 80 hours save file got corrupted 80 hours for nothing.
I legit cannot stop playing this game. I've been playing this game for what feels like years.please send helpsincerely someone who is addicted to a game no matter how many bad matches i go through

really fun and naked people with rocks
very nice game )
kinda weird how i got banned for using a macro on pubg not rust but i guess i had rust open atm so i would recommend kinda bad anticheat doesnt ban real cheaters and bans me for using a macro on pubg alright
If you're looking for a fast paced car game with balls I think this is top 1. Better with friends Competitive Scene Growing Community. All around great game with all major known bugs fixed No issues with FPS unless you have a toaster and banging soundtracks
Very Good game
Great game
REGION LOCK CHINA FOR S SAKE
great game but give me a kill cam like call of duty where i can see what happend right after i die even in duos and squads thanks have a nice day!

Best game ever
Fun and gleefully violent. Don't tell mommy.

cool game D
The best game I've ever played . Best played with friends.
It is a good game but i feel i ran out of things to do by myself and only have fun if i have people to play with
This game is kinda like football But above FIFA it stands tall.For powered rockets and many sprockets.This is my most played above all.
Gud game!!I rate 9/10
I was running across an open field and saw this other guy do a super jump. He leaped over a tall building across from where i was running. I got on the ground and prayed. I want to refund my life to god now.
Esste super tare
Super crap game but fun to screw around on.
Good game go on x1000 raid russian people and enjoy.
Its such a good game scary intense and exciting!
Lots of bugs with controllers.
"Great game thats full of potential!!! Please keep up the work! The game has good graphics that can be easily ran on low graphics pc's and the games whole everything is user friendly and it takes me out of the harsh FPS's and MMO's and puts me in a calm and relaxing game. If you like space engineers you'll love this game. Keep up the ""eye candy"" of the game! The game has so many different shapes and textures! It makes the game have its own Pop! The game is good for any age between 10 15+ in my opinion Overall 9.5/10. I am really excited to see this game grow into something amazing Carl the unofficial official game reviewer"
Combine this game with FiveM and ReShade for a truly immersive experience...
Hacker very boring
I dont know if I just suck or everyone is a hacker but I have yet to come across any English speaking people in the NA server. Oh...and I die all the time.

OMG!OMG!OMG!Chat disabled for 4 seconds.
MiniCar ball mean Dnc game plaync graphicnc everywhere D
Not really a survival game more so a build game with looting. Great if you want to waste time to play effectively you should build or hunt not both all the time. Doesn't really have any realistic survival mechanics in the game. This is more so a shooter with crap that spawn you can loot and build with.
The game is overall really good. The only issue that it used to have a lot of hackers but recently I haven't seen any.
Really Fun Game And u should play with friends its better and more fun ) ! When u make tactic To Score points !
Do not purchase this game until it is updated once again. It is literally unplayable in the state that it is in currently. The next patch is said to launch on the 20th. It may be worth it after that point but as of right now this game should not be purchased.
0/10 Not enough mustache.
w3
Deer clucked at me. 11/10
Game seems to have issues with AMD processors. I well exceed the minimum requirements by at least 8 gb in every direction yet the game runs incredibly choppy with FPS lag as low as 20. There isn't a noticable difference in FPS and performance when operating the game at ultra or very low. I still have FPS spikes. The volume needs work as shots echo as if they were passing through a tunnel. The recent patch made a VERY small improvement on my end in terms of performance and has seemed to make it more difficult to find any weapons (6 attempted games after patch and located only 1 AK despite being first in that area). Typically I end up locating a pistol and just getting easy kills on unfortunate players that have a frying pan. This is idiotic and takes away from the fun and the reason why I would play this game. Currently I would reccommend H1Z1 heavily over Battlegrounds mostly due to performance issues and lack of quality gameplay. Save your $30 until they improve the game significantly.
"iest Game i have ever bought. Game is extremley boring Combat is ing Cancer along with the community and the game modes are so repetative. You could shoot a guy in the chest with a full magazine but he can have on auto aim and shoot you in the head with a single round after you shot him mutliple times and he will run away Typing in chat ""get rekt quot Like i have never been more disapointed in a GTA Game. The community feels like you are playing a survival game. Hackers are infested. and Devs just add new cars and colors. Im never buying this and if I could i would get my money back."
.
Great Game!!
It sucks 9/10
Not good
Hey guys i know this game have some major problem but is very good if you wanna have fun with your friends and play a battle royale tipe game rly i recommend!
Fun and competitive.
You don't win rust you just get better every time.
nice game
I have paid this game to receive a with a lot of bugs and errors
"A lot of people are boo hooing BlueHole for 'breaking a promise' on microtransactions. They're entitled to their opinions but BlueHole's microtransactions don't affect anything. They give some flavor potential for those that want to spend some money on the potential for cool skins but you aren't forced to buy anything that would make you more efficient in game. To negatively review a game because you felt entitled to a ""microtransaction free environment"" is petty and childish. The addition of these transactions literally affects nothing at all. Another lot of people don't like third person. You should know up front that this game is 3P and that affects gameplay in a major way for people expecting to play it like a FPS. If you're in a house and concerned about someone peeking you use your ears position yourself intelligently listen for doors opening or footsteps. The game is amazingly fun and provides an incredible amount of entertainment. The devs are reasonably quick to fix issues. This is far and away the most I've ever played a pre release game and I have no intentions of dropping it from my play queue any time soon."
Who made this game? Where did it come from? Seriously? This game just pops out of the annals of nowhere and blows gamers away with an immense amount of fun.Buy this game. It's too good to pass up.
The solo game is a masterpiece the online part is a disgrace. Also increasing the price just before summer sales is bad practice.
Laggy riddled with cheaters worst hit registration of any FPS gun play feels like it's happening underwater glitchy movement so poorly optimized that framerate sucks with a 1080 TI. One of the worst FPS games I've played in my life.
Very fun game especially when you play with friends tension/ suspense surrounds you and you are frightend but you have a lot of good laughs from this game )
First I was scared to buy the game cause of some reviews of people but it's totally worth it!
DO NOT SUPPORT THIS. They let hackers run free ban legit players and BAN the moding which actually gave a fresh breath in the singleplayer since their focus is on ONLINE which you have to spend large ammount of time griding or buy shark cards to get more useless stuff..Now T2 is shutting down modding...P.s. forgot to mention they raised the price before the sale/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Well more than a year has passed for this game on PC *Alot more was added like freemode events stunt series &amp tons of cars.*Alot less hackers than before there are some but no obvious hacker insanity cluster like before.*People alot less lively nobody speaks that much via microphone no more but servers are always populated.*Heists are harder to complete because not many want to waste time and patience for them since they can farm freemode and other events*Missions &amp heists still have long loading times (thank god for free mode events)*Heist leavers are unpunished there is no way to just go back and find one player after someone leaves you are just thrown back into free mode again and have to invite everyone again which is pain in the and time consuming*Last heist (pacific bank) is abused with kuruma which makes things too easy and people still fail*Online mode is less lively some of the pedestrians missing in certain places no wildlife some aircrafts/vehicles are gated or not available online*Some car upgrades are unlocked by winning races.. And i don't mean top 3 or anything you have to finish first which is hard if you're matched up with players of same skill so many people abuse it by purposely losing races for each other*Upgrades cost more than in singleplayer. And sometimes you get unreasonable fees fixing the car from a small bump*Vip work and CEO organisation work gave mayhem some kind of purpose*Highly customisable cars (benny's) upgrades costs alot so you either farm cash or buy shark cards(don't buy shark cards)*Yachts are basically static waste of money with few mini events and cost alot so Rockstar really wants you to buy shark cards. Basically your e p*nis..*No more content for singleplayer (sad)*Kuruma still has insurance for some reason. I mean come on if someone gangs up on you with it it's damn hard to kill them without blowing up the car and paying their insurance.*Weapon wheel is a mess. You have to cycle through all of the weapon types and cannot remove certain weapons so it makes it harder to fight sometimes*Major shuttering issues are fixed although there some texture popping issues specialy on windows 10*For some reason Online works worse then singleplayer with shutters texture pop ins and other weird stuff*Input lag. Sometime this thing happens out of nowhere.*Community is kind of toxic but that is expected for this satire game. Even the game is built in such way so people could screw over each other so expect players talking respawn camping you chasing all over the map just for killing them that one times or bumping into their vehicle*Customer support is non existent you have better luck searching the forums for help from other players or googling going on youtube to find solutions for your issues.This game is worth it's price even for just it's singleplayer witch is about 30 50 hours depending on your playstyle . Story is weaker than IV's in my opinion but still awesome. One of the few games I bought at full price and the only game i pre ordered got my moneys worth.ps. don't waste money on shark cards.

"I've made this review years ago saying quote ""It's a great game and it brings a lot of fun R* ofically allowed mods ! YAY "".Don't get me wrong GTA V and the whole GTA series is awesome and as hard as it is to give this game a negative review I just can't live without mods. Mods always have been an essential part of the grand theft auto community and it should all be ruined by the shitpot called ""GTA Online"". Not on my watch. R* can proceed doing this but I doubt that I will buy any title of them ever again."
Funny game must play big chance of getting killed.
Spawn. Resource. Build. Raids. Wipe. Repeat
the best game of extreme hide and seek if you enjoy being murdered.
This game was a lot of fun. The only problem with this game is it needs to be the only game you play. It requires a MASSIVE amount time that needs to be dedicated just to do well. Very interesting concept loved it. Just dont have the time to play it.
It's a great game. There are a lot of options and game modes to play online. The only problem is the toxic people but that's life. You can blame Rockstar Take Two o whoever you want but people is like that. There's no online game without toxic people and this game is a good place for them. Some people will try to ruin your game just for fun.Biggest problem modders. You will find a hacker in every two games. I find it unbelievable how usual it is to find a hacker. I really can't understand how Rockstar doesn't have anything prepared to detect them as soon as they're triggered because they're everywhere literally. It's a huge problem you'll have to find a new server very often. Also you'll see a lot of kids asking for modders in the chat.If you can get around hackers and toxic people you will find a great game. You can do missions play minigames races and make a lot different things. It's hard to get all the stuff you want though as things are expensive and you'll need to spend a lot of time to get all the money you need to buy them.Apart from the online you have the singleplayer wich is very good too although you'll end up playing online or not playing at all.
Noice
fun challenging wacky exciting. Short matches make it easy to play for a little bit without sucking you into a civ style hole.
Edit Seeing that they patch this game pretty frequently I'm going to change my review to a recommended. Though i stand by much of what I said in my previous review. We'll see if they fix the problemsThis game has an AMAZING concept and really needs to be better. I love the gameplay. When it works. WAY too many bugs. I will change my review and sing the games praises if the creators put more energy into fixing bugs. This game was NOT worth the price I paid for it considering how often it simply doesn't work. Buttons sometimes don't register. I've healed people who have already exited and survived. I've fallen through the floor of the map and died. COUNTLESS times I have been sitting waiting at the loading screen until I realize I need to force close the program. You have to make a new party when you want to change who the killer is. Only killer can be host. Garbage. Your core gameplay is really good and the game deserves to not be soffocated by having broken bells and whistles. Fix the game and I'll fix the review.
Too many cancer kids that just kill for fun to ruin everyone's good time in the game.Showing really how those bullies act in real life.The game itself is great
Best game I have ever played in my entire life. You drop out of a plane with 99 other people and you have to try to scavange for weapons and healing items to survive. You get scared to death stressed out overwhelmingly excited happy and best of all the feeling you spent your money good.
Have you ever felt the need to build something amazing and moments later have someone come along who is worlds of technology ahead of you and murder you taking everything you have and destroying what took you hours on hours to build? Then this game is for you.
A Very fun game
Good game
This game sooooo addictive. It should not be this fun but it is. a Very lively community. Great game. Paid full price and do not regret it.
VERY BIG SHOOT SHOOT VERY BIG LOUD CRIME MAKER
The game is okay in my opinion. I really liked it at first but after playing for awhile I wasn't really interested in it. I can see why a lot of people enjoy the game though. It's NOT a bad game but not my cup of tea. I still would recommend to anyone who likes battle royale games.
+REP tons of hacker in FPP and Duo....but 40k player just got ban last month tho XD
This game is fun to play makes you laugh alot with your friends
4 months later this game is still in beta
Product received for free. STILL CHINESE FLOODING NA SERVER. FUKN
Very good game ! i love it !
An epic way to waste your life 10/10 would play again
Battle Royal Done correctly D
Can't recommend this game until they improve the south american serverPro Fun to play. Cons Some matches take forever to find people. You constantly have AFK teammates. AI teammates are The need of buying DLC to 100% the achievements. For other achievements you need friends who also play this game. It's bad for a completionist to depend on other people to 100% a game. Servers are a piece of Ranked doesn't make any sense.
This game is good in its own way. There's some stuff that I really hate it's the loading screen when entering the multiplayer. You see I think I've spend more time in the loading than actually playing it and earn some money from the heist. But I like the game I played the hell out of it on XBOX 360. (I didn't get it on launch though I bought it when it was on sale.) The online experience may differ from one another.The key features that I want to talk about Story The Story is interesting. I love playing it there's this feeling that I get when playing it. The feeling is like when you first started playing a really awesome story based game and you want to know what's going to happen next. Also the illusion that's the game story is long and there's a lot to cover. It kind of have that feeling if you get what I mean. Gameplay I like the overall gameplay of this game but I kind of don't love that fact that there's a like a delay when using a controller for walking and looking around and stuff. I love driving cars around the Los Santos in both multiplayer and singleplayer. Online The online is amazing if you have friends to play with otherwise it's going to get boring at some point. But of course there'll be some people that really like the game can play alone and still enjoying it. I'm not that kind of a person. I love playing the game and all but you see I love co op. Of course you can find friends online and not just some of your mate that you know well. But I'm not really that great at talking with other people. There are some hacker that I've met and don't really care. I mean as long as it doesn't involved me it doesn't matter. A lot of people wants money and I do to but at the same time I don't even thoug I'm really poor in the game right now. I tried to do a lot of heist but there's too much of a problem because it's with strangers and it's better with friends. Performance When the game first came out it have a great performance already. I can totally run it at 60fps on almost maxed out with a Geforce GTX 780. But it gets even better when they're giving out more updates. I'll give this game 8.5/10That's just the number I just pulled out of my head. I will rekommend this game if you have friends to play with or you're type of a person that can totally play by themselves or really good at making friends online.
Best game ever recomend everyone to play it

it is good for you
Great game to around in with friends
Product received for free. I shouldn't say much because every speck of this game is pure gold but whenever i type literally anything in a one of the rockstar editor bars it says 'my text goes against the Terms and Conditions'. This has only happened for a few days help.
A terrible game that is dying. The dev team is a mess and unable to communicate easily within their departments. The game has not delivered on what was promised. There's no mod support there are no custom servers there are no custom maps. There is no way to practice anything other than either the loot simulator or fist fighting if you drop in hot zones. The devs are ruining the competitive community with their lack of knowledge of proper game mechanics and failure to deliver on the bost basic essentials required for a competitive game. The game is still ugly and unoptimized and can barely run on the top end graphics card. Do not buy this unless you have a top of the line cpu graphics card memory and even a top m.2 drive. If you don't have top of the line ram you lose most of your performance and if you don't have an m.2 many game items/buildings will not load in properly and ruin your game.Even the anti cheat is terrible not banning who it should and banning people it shouldn't. A game filled with people aimbotting and flying and they are still wasting time banning people for using povohat's mouse accel. If the third party leaderboards didn't automatically hide cheaters then the leaderboards would reveal the severity of the problem.It's a great idea for a game but another developer needs to swoop in and release a proper version. Maybe the chinese version by tencent can come to america. 1/10. Waiting for a better battlegrounds.
I'd like to tell you to try to fix this problem it is like... when playing surviors we have to find the good (ping) rooms. However sometimes when we are in the good (ping) room most of the killer always disconnect the lobby. This makes survivors spend longer time to find rooms. It is such a waste of time and annoying. Nobody wants to play with 300+ ping rooms. am I right? Please fix this problem as soon as possible. I love your game but I hope you can fix this problem especially THE KILLERS LIKE TO DISCONNECT THE LOBBIES WHEN SEEING ALL SURVIVORS HAVING GOOD ROOM!
realy good game now is time to buy it for this great discount
This game is too much of a derivative of other games like Evolve and especially Friday the 13th. DBD is extremely confusing to newbies the tutorial is very good at explaining the basicis but everything else is lost to them. All the addons boostrers tributies whatever the unlockable or skills are make no sense. If you're in a game with an experianced player with these power ups you have zero chance of winning reguardless if you're the hunter or a survivor. It was intresting to play for free but.. just don't care for these asymmetrical games. I mean who's still playing Evolve anymore?
Rocket League Cars+football AWESSOMENESS!!!!!Buy it you'll not be dissapointed!!!!
This is essentially ADHD Dayz mod. Great though really fun and exiting!As I have played alot of Dayz its soo nice to just quickly get some loot and start fireing.However so far i have to have the graphics set very low because of some optimizing issues so... eyecandy its not if you dont got the specs.Also.. you have to play online with stinky nerds.. )Would recommend lotta fun and with friends
I bought 6 copies of this game from steam and 5 from GMG for family and friends to play with. Out of those 11 copies all work but 2 of them but its just my luck that the one of the two non working copies is the one I am using. I have tried every thing listed on all forums and support pages to fix my issue but nothing works an open ticket from rockstar in an attempt to fix the issue as well but still my issue is not fixed. I can play the game for random amounts of time before the game simply crashes on 2 of my computers and its the same symptoms on both machines. The game running with settings changed from extreamly low to as high as you can set them to test the issue and it crashes no matter what setting even safe mode crashes. I doubt that this issue is something to do with my equipment and I am finished jumping through hoops for support teams with all the uninstall reinstall disable enable rollback restore none of it works. I am convinced that this issue will be corrected with a patch and now I will simply wait until they decide to start looking deeper into the issue on thier end instead of looking at my msinfo file and trying to correct it on my PC. I have over 500 games and this is the first one to have this issue with its persistant crashing I have yet to trouble shoot any other game as much as I have this one and the biggest bummer for me is that when I do get to play this game for the brief amount of time in which my PC works with it the game plays and looks absolutly amazing I have no other game in my library that can touch it. I am hoping they can find a fix in an upcoming patch to fix my issues with this game so that I can enjoy it but until then I will just enjoy listening to my friends and family I purchased the game for enjoy it and focus on thier positive experience with it. I would trade my issues with any of the customers complaining about thier car missing or thier character wasnt tranfered correctly just so that I could play the game. after all those things being ed about are so small in comparison to the constant crashing issue. my specs just in case anyone reading this wants to know Operating System Windows 7 Professional 64 bit (6.1 Build 7601) Service Pack 1 (7601.win7sp1_gdr.150316 1654) Language English (Regional Setting English)System Manufacturer To Be Filled By O.E.M.

I Simply Love this game.Best Battle Royale game.Looking for friends to play with .... Add Me..!!
10/10 would throw Chop's ball at strangers again

Product received for free. I've no problem with it (60fps+ full hd with 780Ti) compared other people.But graphicaly is not good for a 2016 remastered.. Maybe cause engine is old i agree but i prefer wait maybe some MOD for enjoy it.Btw i give it 10/10 cause is Skyrim and work perfectly ( Look my profile for see my Computer info &amp some screenshots ).
this game is great. may ruin your life by taking up so much of it.
nice
Get it for GTA V modding that's it.
There's no FIFA corruption and evildoings of E.A. 10/10 IGN
this game is great i have had no problems until the last patch. since than the game is unplayable with constant network lag and nothing loads in just walking through buildings and terrain. like i said the game was great up until this hopefully they can get this fixed quickly.
Very fun game especially with friends
Naked men 11 10
Best game out there if you have friends to play with and you learn how to play.
This game has found legs and is the new kid on the block who showed off big. However unless they start adding and fixing some issues soon it will just look like a one hit wonder and loose the force they came in with.
Nothing better than the breeze on your balls while trying to gather resources and fight off players to build your own home and spend hours getting the best gear and weapons. Only for you to logoff and it be raided at 3am in the morning...Great game either way.
"Honestly not worth it. Just don't like the game. I liked H1Z1 (when it was good) and I even like Fortnite after playing it for a bit but PUBG just didn't get me. The specular lighting is completely exaggerated and the graphics overall rather hurt my eyes than look nice (and this is coming from a person that doesn't really care about good graphics.)Coming from csgo i literally have zero ""feeling of control"" in the game. Everything is like it's in slow motion. This is kind of hard to explain but people who play csgo will know that you can run strafe around bunnyhop etc. With pubg i can't even control my character while parachuting down the way i want to now this for example is not a problem with fortnite at all.FPS Just trash. Not much to say. My rig isn't the best with a GTX 970 MSI and an i7 6700k but it's also not that bad. Even when optimizing graphic settings putting things on low etc. my fps are still bad and the game looks even worse. Skillgap Well it's not really high. Again not to advertise or praise Fortnite but the building aspect gets the game to another level. Simply landing in buildings playing looting and running simulator isn't my understanding of fun. Did that enough in H1Z1.Overall this game is/was overhyped and it's honestly i can't even come up with a single positive thing about it. I've never really seen the point of playing Battle Royale games but i still had fun in h1z1 and fortnite. Not at all with PUBG though."
Very cool game principally because of the engine but graphics need to be optimized
Just run like you dont care oh and if the host has bad connection you are ed. Teleporting is GREAT.
Product received for free. Everyone crying about paid mods but i have like 80 mods and another 35 from the nexus mixed and matched into this game and it does'nt crach like OldRim......i haven't paid for a single mod and most of the people i see giving this a bad vote have barely even an hour played on the game _ its a good game get it simple as that bye.
Product received for free. its not bad
Would give a mixed review but I tend to not recommend it (anymore)
If you are into fun gaming and non stop action youneed to get this game.is is soo cool and theres only one little problem but its nobiggy. if you can affordthis amazing game i would100% recommend this game
D
The game used to be super fun. Now the servers are extremely poor. I cannot even use full automatic on the guns as they simply will not want to shoot. In fact I have died more times in the past week due to server lag problems and hackers than I have anything else. Until these issues have been fixed I probably will not be playing much. The above issues ruin the experience and Bluehole seems to be completely ignore the problems at hand. When these issues are solved I will gladly change the negative review.*I came back and played after they have done some more updates. NA has been overrun with cheaters. I have been instantly headshot by people not even looking at me for the past 5 straight games. I would say that I get to play one cheater free game in approximately every 15 matches. It is that bad. This game has somehow gotten worse since my previous review. Please do not buy this game! Stay away from it at all cost! Maybe a region lock would help a little bit however that would not address the underlying issue. Their anti cheating system is a joke and people are walking all over it.*
Hey well.The hacker strikes again.It was all fun and games until someone made everyone continuously explode on the server preventing you from reaching your phone or the menu to set passive mode.What about escape and reach the game settings you ask ? Well you couldn't either because you kept dying which made the menu disappear each time.Well Done R*. The online experience is just a big pain in the booty.
Excellent game! Matches are short but fulfilling. Totally worth the price tag.
amazing game if you like pvp farming and raiding people ))
Fun game to play with your friends. And a amazing game in general
Right when i joined the game some guy just asked for my rock. I just gave it to him and he just game me 200 peaces of wood. Fair trade i suppose... untill i had a deathwish and got speared.
In the deepest night from time to time some lights. You want to go to them they lure you promising to show you the path. But he is there somewhere hunting you waiting near the lights to take you and hang you like a pig.To slaughter you. To make you suffer. To smell your blood arround him. To kill YOU. Wait! Did you hear this? RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yes he s after you! Maybe i ll be able to outrun him. Look a window....jump through it...he is slower at this than you! Ohh....thank god...this time was so close.... i managed to escape. Let s find the way OUT!. Generators are running lets run to the gate. I can see it uhh i esc....BANG!!!!???!!!! I can feel the wind and...what is this excruciating pain??? My god it hurts!.....like hell!!! Why i can t touch the ground? what is this....???!!?? OMG ! He catched me!!!! ....Enjoy the game. Worth every cent.
Product received for free. This game was a gift from a friend. At first the game was fun (this was around June July) however as time passed the game became less enjoyable. Many problems occured in PUBG over the course of a few months. Usually at the same graphics that ran on my computer it was not choppy. However after a few updates this game not only became extremely choppy for me but for my friend who owns a custom built computer worth well over $1500. I could list multiple reasons why I wouldn't recommend this game but overrall the game worsened overtime.
Yeh forget my last review its crap.its a buggy mess and it will never be a finished game.
Enjoyable yes
Was taken by the ninja turtles to their secret mountain hideout then 6/5 IGN
good game
very good game!
REGION LOCK CHINA

Awesome

Nagyon szep! )))))))))))))
Too many chinise cheaters every game after 1.0 release. Getting whooped out by instant headshots with AKM only by Chinise names in EU servers. It needs massive ban wave.
It a fun game that you can play with youre friends.
This game is an ill advised purchase if you want to play casually against people of your skill level. i play with a team for 3v3 on an irregular basis and we'll win 2 5 games against people of our skill and then we'll be put against PROFESSIONAL rocket league players!!??!?!? im not good at this game but i can do a better job than most but going against professionals isn't fun and enraging to play against. IF you want to consider this game then just play bots because it's actually fun to play against people jumping off walls and hitting the ball in the middle of the arena isn't fun to play against. and don't buy the dlc.
good but needs improvements
It's ok
Gooooooooooooooooooooood game
This game as an awsome idea for the game but the servers are way too laggy. you can hit someone and see blood. but they havnt taken any dmg. fix servers and we goood . as the game is now its not to recomend.
SO boring!
I have 900+ hours (edit 1 600 + Hours) on the game and I haven't gotten bored of it. This game updates pretty frequently and you 100% WILL GET MAD at some point and if you can't handle set backs then this game isn't for you. You will die and lose all of your stuff and you will get raided and you need to have the mind set of not if im gonna get raided its when your gonna get raided (edit I don't find myself getting raided that much anymore). If your new start on a low population server or play on a server with no one (edit It would help with the beginning or you could just go straight to high pop servers). Always upgrade your foundations first or they WILL get shot or burned by a flame thrower.
How on gods green earth is this still priced at $59.99???
The new map is and it won't cycle to eringale... I shouldn't play 20+ games and only play on one map when there is supposed to be 2 maps. Just fyi this game does still crash...
Great game. Still needs work to improve. This is a very sand boxy type of game so you may need to give it some time to figure out. Try playing with a friend as it is 10 times more enjoyable.
if u dont have a good graphics card then kiss your experience good bye
Best survival game out there highly recommended.
Awesome Game
stop playing for maybe 2 months come back and all of the I grinded out for gone.There goes my enthusiasm to play this game anymore camping and the fact that its been months since its release but still no in game comms other than the idiotic chat board just held this game back. They would much rather release as much skins as they can to milk this game
As usual this GTA is more awesome than the last. Stunning graphics. A big list of activities and missions from a killing frenzy challenge to a session of yoga. Now with 3 playable characters switchable at any time. This new addition brings with it the new heist missions where you plan and execute a big job playing the 3 characters.Didn't play GTA Online but the game is worth it for the single player alone. The best game of its genre!
its really goog
Infested with Hackers and bugs critical to gameplay (cars sometimes teleport and crash into things dropping out of the parachute often causes damage when it shouldnt)
Rockstar has ruined PC GTA
"This game is my most played games (I don't have a lot of time on my hands). It is the best game I've played in a while and despite what people say about ""loads of Chinese hackers"" may be true but I've experienced it once BEFORE the 1.0 update. The 1.0 update has vastly improved things and to be honest it's worth the price tag. I have bought the game for 3 friends all of which love the game to bits! I highly recommend this game as long as you have friends to play with as solo is pretty boring after a while."
Nice game !
Pretty ballsy game as you can turn the censor off!
would be awsome to see a competitive mode more guns and possibly more maps in the future. but good game. 10/10.
take two
great game! super intense and heart pounding. The registers for opening doors and getting in a car are sorta like teleporting. The rain is also annoying because you literally can hear nothing at all. It is like being in a hurricane. Needs some polish but overall worth every dollar especially with friends.After 59 matches in COD blackout i would 100% say just buy COD its sooooo much better and the developers are updating daily and care about the community
I was told on the game manu to tell them they are bad at their job so here i am.
It's just too good xD
Is it worth the hype? Probably not.Do people play it as muc has yesteryear? No.Is it still fun? Sometimes.
Бесконечная загрузка..........
Bugged game 0/10 super buggy pls fix before releasing skins you company
Buy it if your friends have it or don't buy it at all. (Unless you're buying it for the story mode)
無理げーお部材やー
this game is good but the server like !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Optimization was a very big issue for a very long time but it now runs pretty smoothly. The gameplay is very intense and action packed what I would expect in a ""AAA Battle Royale Game""."
1) Go In plane2) Loot3)Die4)RepeatI mean thats all we need to say about this game! Its really fun and intense! Brilliant!
Product received for free. A TRUE test of skill strategy and occasional chaos. A simple premise with rewarding gameplay. It can be frustrating exciting dramatic and sometimes intense. Scratches several itches if you love fast paced gameplay that rewards quick reactions savvy team play and skill based learning.9/10
Look the game as a whole could use a bit of work that being said... it is a fun game. The main problem is the recent monitization of the game.In Game Currency Basically pointless only can be used to buy crates which are 80% of the time locked for which you will have to buy a 2.50 key with real money to unlock. The other 20% of the time its an unlocked crates which contains nothing good.Battle Pass System Finally introducted something to work towards in the game instead of randomly playing. To bad they have put it behind a pay wall. And even if you pay its only for a limited time and the rewards from completion the missions are pretty For a game that cost $30 you would expect most content to be able to be earnt. Not as soon as you enter please pay us more money to not look like a pleb or to give you something to work toward. I dont have a problem with micro transcations but within reason. If they want a player base that will keep coming back they need to have a reason more than just try and win. In my opintion they need to make battle passes free or AT LEAST can be bought with in game currency. I will keep playing this game infrequantly but if you want people to spend money on a game its better to make them WANT TO not FORCE THEM TO.
BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!!!!!!!!!
rubbish.
Product received for free. The Best
A very solid action game marred by console interface and janky online implementation. Tons of fun with friends when you can get over the weirdness in actually getting together to play.
no skill needed only luck. game. also bikes don't tend to work. it flips outta nowhereEDIT Broke promise of no microtransactions in early access. nice work
this game
Best early access game I've bought.
The gameplay time says it all.
As a long time fan of the GTA series and owning the entire series the beginning of the story was fun but halfway through changing characters gets a little annoying. Being a bank robber is different than being a gangster or mobster like the others in the series but was a fun change.over all after beating the game twice I have to say the game was fun but I was wanting a bit more with single player dlc. The online portion was similar to the story. At first it was fun but once you get all of the jobs(CEO making fake money making drugs having a MC etc) it literally becomes the same missions over and over again. Not only that but rockstar made it that you get very little money from doing these jobs forcing you to buy shark cards or play the game like world of Warcraft.which at first sounds fun and resonable but in practice becomes boring and a grind fest(since your doing the same missions over and over). Overall I would get it for single player and mods absolutely fun. But I wouldn't get it JUST for the online even with friends too much of a grind without the fun of being a traditional mmo.
First off most of the lil kittens who cry about the game are whining about the ' micro transactions '.. Which is strange considering its only for ' visual ' items ... that have NO EFFECT in game.. Cept maybe letting you run around in a white outfit which sets you up as a giant target.. So Ignore anyone who has a problem with that.. They are just looking for a reason to cry. There are some bugs some terrible an nasty ones.. but they have been slowly patching them . I have played 50 or so games so far with no bug ' having cost me the game '.. If you have a few friends to play with this is a GREAT experience. Is each battle based on RNG? Why yes it is people cry about lack of weapons an being at the mercy of RNG... Guess what everyone has that same chance.. Its part of the experience! Its like these morons crying about ' there were 4 guys who dropped at the house i wanted '.. well guess what.. its a mechanic.. plan for it.. adjust your plan.. hell the circles are random.. so crying about that is similiar! The whole point is you have what you find an adjust as best you can! For the cost you wont find anything as fun! No progression.. just a different experience every time! Though i will say trying to play SOLO isnt overly enjoyable.. Something about working with more people using tactics .. much more fun!
Rockstar North Please stop inhibiting mods. You have a chance to build a ever changing community around your game yet you drive them away under the notion of protecting GTA Online.GTA Online is an enjoyable feature no doubt but many PC gamers would like more out of your game. Personally I'd be happy with any acknowledgement of that on your part.Edit I'm satisfied with the response on rockstar's part. If you are itching to play multiplayer with mods keep an eye on GTA MP(they are working on a client that could possibly allow LAN). Now excuse me as I have a riot to quell.Edit Edit Fool me once shame on you.
After 66 hours I ate my chicken dinner.I have not come back to this establishment. 4/5
One tip Play on servers that allow the exact amount of friends you got cause then you have a chance of dominating instead of getting tossed around by a 20 player+ clan
This game could be really good but the devs refuse to fix glaring imbalancing in the game so I cannot recommend this game to anyone except the most casual of players. Do not spend money on this game once you become good you will hate it.
I mean I played this game for around 300h now and I have some mixed feelings about it... The game itself is great. But there are some really gamebreaking bugs like random crashes flying cars missing or late spawning loot and some more. I would really love to see the devs addressing those problems instead of implementing more skins and now also weapon skins... yay more ways to earn money from games wuhuuu . fix it before making it prettier /
Its a good game but it gets boring really fast
very cool game wish they could add the San Andreas map as a additional server choose option..
Why the are supressors in this game???? It is OP af and makes the gun silent when it shoots. smh blizzard fix game pls or throw for dafran.
When I bought H1Z1 and played it for like 200 hours I though to myself this is probably the worst game I have ever played. I was wrong. This would be remembered as the worst game I have ever played D
Drive cars into a big ball. 10 /10

Monster hunter is finally released to a new generation thats not a title on the handhelds? Seems like I've been waiting since the original to get back into Monster Hunter proper. So glad Monster Hunter World is that game. Reminds me of all the good times i use to have and I'm having a blast.The game had a more than rocky launch but it's a lot better now. Still those first few weeks hurt the game a lot i'm sure. Definitely recommend for anyone just looking now to get into it. It's been fixed quite a bit and is an awesome game!
Modding is an essential part of this game and a lot of PC games
The New Map Sucks BallsHitReg is worse then CS GO and that's saying something
Why have i played over 400 hours of pubg? Well obviously i must hate my life. I do not understand how someone can create a game this bad and still have the most users on steam ever. Combat sux. The game is glitchy as and laggs ALL THE TIME. I regret ever giving these devs money...
It's like all the action movies compiled into one game with vehicles and driving that feels almost like Need For Speed and gunplay like The Matrix.... You've got nice customization and campaign is alright but serves more as a tutorial to the superior online mode GTA ONLINE.... I would recommend this a lot
Is a fun game to play with friends
жалею что раньше не купил игра замечательная нашел в ней офигенных друзей и массу позитива единственный минус это требованние 8гиг минимальный озу это перебор
Pro's Amazing Graphics Loads of Guns Awesome Physics / Semi Realism Lots of Custimization Fun Alone (for some) and Fun in GroupsCon's Movement is sort of clunky got better as of recently but needs some tweaks The game is unoptimized (will be fixed over time) To many campers not fun to play aggresive due to this (in solos) Hackers are starting to appear since beta and still are somewhat an issue but rare Somewhat Buggy Mechanically
Fakin won my first game I'm the best kappa no but seriously 30 is a bit too much but it is nais.
they tell players all about there work and always keep you updated. and its a amasing game.
Best football game ever!

Great game. 10/10

nice game &lt 3
I really enjoyed this game at first. Then they came out with an update to lowered the blue zone times. It ruined a great game. I do not recommend this game due to the fact you can no longer strategize as you have to run zone to zone once it starts.
take two
If you look past all the modders and the bad economy gta 5 actually are a decent game. especially if you are playing online with a couple of friends.7/10
Good game
Game of run around for 20 minutes shoot sager shotgun into guy less then 2 metres he just lags around and u die.
CAN'T GET PAST THE CRASH AT LAUNCH MISSION ANY SUGGESTIONS?
Dead by daylight is a good game for starting with horror games it is a very intense game and has many updates whtch gives more killers and maps overall Dead by Daylight is awsome game
Worst anti cheating system in a game ever! You will consistently play against hackers almost every game now and run into the EXACT SAME hackers DAYS after you reported them. This makes me assume their anti cheat system and reporting system is just non existent basically. Cant even solo squad a game in ANY REGION without geting teamed up with chinese players whom you cant communicate with at all. The community has been asking for region lock and yet the developers choose to ignore them because majority of their players are in Asia. This game could be so good if they cared about their community at least a little bit.
I have played this game for 200 hours and I can not say it has no bugs but from what I saw in the future update will be much more optimized and resolved from the bugs.
9 dlc's to buy
Great concept great game but the goddam cheating is ridiculous. Fix it!!
Best game ever fk fortnite
The only place where communism works
Great game have loads of fun on it and im not to bothered when i die either
Very fun to play and they are doing good job against hack tools.
If you think someone is a cheater... he is
Product received for free. Long loading Toxic community Laggy servers Not fun by yourself
Extremely unbalanced. Survivors are at a complete disadvantage. There are so many mechanics that give the killer the leading edge over survivors. Even new killers can win against experienced survivors and the perks for killers is completely unfair. A joke of a game and a joke of a developer.
Great game. Was minding my own business one day when 10 men dressed in all black with machine guns came and took my friend I. They gave us new names. His was Slave3 and mine was FatSlave. Slavery isn't all that bad. Just lot's of manual labor. Master makes fat jokes about me and makes Slave3 and I fight to the death. Best way to experience a game.. as a slave!
Great game!
new battle pass was waste of money no real progression fix the game first before u start launching battle to many glitches
Way to ruin your own game 'DOpenIV &lt 3
Thats pretty good!!!!
hi
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE GETTING BANNED AND ROCKSTAR DONT CARE!I went to play online and the game loaded into my appartment after approximtely 10 seconds I was kicked out to single player. I then received an email from Rockstar informing me that I have been banned and that my character has been reset. I asked them why because I have NEVER modded this game in anyway and I got back a generic response pretty much saying...'whatever we dont give a . This issue is all over Steam and the internet. There are the usaul trolls accusing people of lying but I GENUINELY have NEVER done anything wrong with that game. I will NEVER purchase another Rockstar game. Dirty Vile company!!!
Screw this company after what this company did to the modding community!EDIT Sign this petition please https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
best game for ever 87
fix your ing optimization.good game though.
gotta have a great pc
Product received for free. alright first of all let me say this game is a classic and one many rpg players or gamers in general will never forget me included but does this remaster live up to the hype? yes and noI cant really complain about wasting money because I got it for free alongside the other people with all the DLC i digress what i mean by no is the pc players specifically the modded players. I myself played around 430 hours of always 100+ mods and it was amazing i loved the game skyrim base and with mods the entire experience kicks off but any modded player will tell you skyrim just isnt as good without mods the graphics cant compare some followers e.g. Sofia are far superior and much more. And i completely agree I would never play skyrim vanilla vs skyrim modded if i had the choice. and its just the vanilla vs modded experience is heavily one sided on the mod side so theres no point instantly upgrading unless you yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods.but what i mean by yes is in about 2 3 months if enbs are supported and the modders of skyrim port their mods into the new game as many are already itll be faaaaaaaaar better because of bethesda fixing some bugs and the new 64bit engine and the scripts (although when it comes out you should 100% swap to skse se because its far far far superior and many mods require it e.g skyui) so when everything gets updated and ported it should be a far superior experience compared to 2011 skyrim.overall i most likely wont be playing the game for a while at least until skse or skyui somehow is supported for the new game. But when those mods are ported and availible for the game? ill be playing like its 2011 again im really excited for the remastered mods but a remaster of the actual game? didnt need it it wouldve been nicer to see a full new fresh remaster of oblivion or morrowind instead. so in conclusion theres no point instantly upgrading unless you yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods. However if you just want to play the game without mods go ahead and play its just a better skyrim for you but if you want mods youre gonna have to wait until skse se releases but when it does ill be playing it for sure alongside of many other people
It has come to the point where english speaking enemies are less dangerous than chinese speaking teammates
Nice
pretty good
Game is super fun but they're so problems that I think will hurt the growth of this game if they do not fix it (Grouped matchmaking and staying in qeue instead of hitting ready over and over again. )
Amazing Game
Oyunun amınakoymulsunuz salak salak recoilleri arttırmışsınız yok yeni gripler gelmiş hepsi ne sikime yarıyorsa hacklar artmış lootlar geç çıkıyo inerken fps sıkıntısı oluyo
Terrible physics very hardware demanding camp rewarding extremally random game due to loot and zone spawns... literally this game has it all to make you angry. Not worth playing even if it would be free to play.
Game is a lot of fun and theres so much to do!
WARNING!!!! You will become addicted and angry in this game. It is by far the best survival game. It has everything min raft should of had. GUNS FORTS CLANS TURRETS. It is extremely difficult. I have only just gotten good and I have 350 hrs on it. If u don't want a game where u will die right when u are doing well this isn't ur game. Something to help is that u should never trust anyone NO MATTER WHAT. Kill them on sight! But also try to be hidden and make sure not everyone knows where u live. Good luck fellow survivor I'll see u on the beach.
its lags HEAPS /
I was promised chicken dinners and now I'm starving to death. 10/10
Rust legacy was great dropping the ability to play it for this new version was stupid
Goodgame
In the current state of this game (Yes 1.0) I cannot reccomend this game at all. First off the Chinese players and subsequently the hackers from that region and Russia too are just ruining the experience. BlueHole needs to region lock servers. Seriously. Region lock Asia from accessing US servers. Secondly I take pride in overclocking my hardware which I can say PUBG does not like one bit. I've never had a game crash my PC as much as this one does. It's absolutely terrible when it happens. No I don't have defective hardware. Yes I've ran extended stability benchmarks with AIDA64 Prime95 and Superposition for 2 18 hours at a time and never overheat never crash and never have any problems with pushing hardware to its limits but when I play this game every single time my PC crashes. Fix your BlueHole. I'm seriously regretting this purchase but I do hope it gets better moving forward. I'll revise my review at a later date when the game has been built on more.
I think this is a grate game to play and its very fun can never see any bugs but they should add special event crates.
best game ever
Fun!! Has a long away to go to be a complete game but it's in a good path
a decent battle royale game and is worth a buy if you like the genre
good
its g ood game i a tried to aplay but a i s hard i canot unot carrot oink it asaid but i camt believ cow in against itjust wait un til it goes a sale ore check on friend
its a good game
This game is one of a kind true gem. It's one of the very few games in my library that I go back to every single day just to play for fun alone or with some friends. I can tell you now that if you really want this game but don't know if you should buy it full price listen to these next two words very carefully... BUY IT. At $20 this game is a must have even more should it go on sale (which is pretty common as it has been on sale numerous times recently.
Freaking sweet game worth the wait!
Garbage filled with closet cheaters and zergs.
Great Game
I miss the early access times so much. The game was much better then. I'd rather go play Rainbow Six.
Product received for free. After 70 hours i played th4is game. I have to say that BlueHole destroyed it with the 1.0 update. When i want to play the OLD map. 99% of the time i get the new desert map. I was trying over 80 times!! and still got the desert map / (bluehole if you see it please add map selector in the lobby!!) I am actually about to quit the game.

Take Two decided to cease and desist the OpenIV team essentially killing mods for single player for no good reason. This is something we should and will not stand for. If the single player is going to be left to die with no DLC while the Online continues to be filled with hackers and then you decide to kill the one thing making the single player more fun I see no reason why I should play your game anymore.
I only bought GTA V to play GTA Online with a fellow friend. I definitely haven't seen everything but so far I'm not that happy with this game. Here's why.Likes vast open world lots of toys guns vehicles to play with you can play it online with friends simulates (gangster) life more or less accuratelyDislikes long loading times inaccurate to aim with guns when using a mouse very time consuming. Don't buy this game unless you've got enough time to spend on one game. demanding on older hardware and thus sometimes laggy or not loading everything on time. can't buy online seperately from offline version of the game (I only want to play with friends not alone) consumes about 60 GB of memoryWho I would recommend to buying this game open world and modern gangster fans people with ENOUGH TIME. If not ask your friends if somebody has it and you could try it out for yourself.
Awful.
Best ing game ever
I have mixed feelings. I love the game but its hard to not hate the player. The game is built in a somewhat toxic gamestyle. Nothing bad about it they did a good job at building a very competive atmosphere. Just don't get asshurt when you get rekt and told to git gud. Just git gud. Keep playing and making mistakes. Each time you get screwed you can take it as a learning experience and just not do it on the next server. My only issue is that I find a lot of admin abuse in the community servers. I wish there was a halfway between community servers and official. Some category for the professionally run community servers would be nice. Nothin is worse than losing cuz an admin is abusing priv. You can't learn from that. I also have a lot of ideas that would be cool for this game ie elevator gears/high qual/ rope/metal frags. can build into bases to go up a bunch of floors faster than opening and closing a ladder hatch each story.Cams that you can place around your base and check in on from a laptopCrude oil as a base defense. this would be nice to defend a weak spot in your base design or to kill doorcampers from above costs crude oil or low grade pour oil from base and light ground below on fire for a timechainsaw metal frags/lowgrade/wood/HQ can be used as weapon or to cut down trees yields 75 to 100 wood per 1.1 seconds (i think salvage axe is 50/1.25) breaks over time and can be repaired. costs low grade to run&gt &gt .... I might add more ideas to this list. let me know what u guys think
Bad game. any new update cost too much to do and getting enough money in the game to buy anything is almost impossible because it takes way to long
New players dont even bother playing this... you WILL be wrecked.
good game
I personally feel as if this is a great game I have have had this game for over a year now and still I am not bored of it. It is a good game to come to after a good long break because you feel as if you are better than before. Might I also mention how the Rocket League community is not as toxic like some others. Also met a lot of good players through rocket league and easy to find people you are compatiable to be teammates with. So to sum it up I would get this game if I were you not only because it is good and it's fairly cheap compared to a $60 game.
hhhhhh
This is just an AMAZING game! With the DLC's you can buy your cars can look beastly. This game has easily become one of my new favorite games within a few days of playing the game. But there's only one problem when searching for online matches there is no Canada east/west regions _ ... Like everyone forgets about Canada a lot of the time when it comes to selecting regions in games. But still a great and super fricking fun game!
this game is aids. koreans suck at coding. irish ppl suck in general.
horrible game
&lt 3&lt 3&lt 3&lt 3&lt 3&lt 3
Fighting monsters feels fantastic. Hopefully they continue to add new beasts in the future
Great game but very overrated lots of bugs and little issues but would recommend 10/10
Let me start out by saying that GTA V is worth the 60$. Does that mean you should try to get cheaper? Hell yes! But if you can't then still worth the 60$. Alright now for the review. It's pretty amazing what they have done with this game not only is there a great single player portion but the online portion is where it really shines. There is nothing like getting together with your buddies and being a bunch of murderous criminals. you can even go golfing if you really want to.
While I've had plenty of grips/issues with Rust over the years I would have a hard time not recommending this game. Even if the game were to turn to complete right now I'd still have to recommend it. I spent $20 on Rust and have gotten 1600+ hours of entertainment out of it you can't get much better than that.
This game is one of the funnest but most time consuming games I've ever played. If you play it once you will be hooked. ADVICE Do not make enemies unless you want a whole server after you like me. (Im famous for that). Just be cool and rek and u will be legit.
THIS IS MY MOST LIKED GAME GET THIS ITS SO MUCH FUN
真的很棒的一款游戏 和朋友们一起玩很好
If you like building a big base/home get offline for 2 hours then get back online only to see that you've been raided and lost everything then Rust is the game for you. But in all seriousness Rust needs work but if effort is put into it it will be worth my 20 dollars. As of now yes it is a fun game to play... with friends. Being alone in Rust is like being on a plane full of terrorists with nothing to defend yourself with. Yes I do recommend this game. Only because it has much potential and if you wait it will turn into a game worth waiting for.
Great game! Highly recommended!
Good game.
very nice game
I'm MHW fan. i been wait since PSP.This game is definitely a very good game. i'm still bough it if it a offline game.But when u said it can play online and turn out can't. that's bad.i invite many of my freind to play. now i feel bad. ( now they fix it. it's alot better.

게임이 시작이 안되는점 오류 많이나오는점
I love Rocket League it so much fun and action is awesome. Sadly one thing I dont like is the crate system you have to spend real money to open them but it seem they giving a new item to help.
"The ""Your First Day in Rust"" video is slightly inaccurate if you're on a high population server you'd probably get killed by fully geared riflemen about halfway through building your first house. But don't let that stop you the game is meant to be challenging like this and so you have to band together with others to stand up against the raiders and bandits. This game is so much fun and even better with friends. Watch your back though."
BEST GAME EVER.
Can you please not update the fckng game ???? u always it up... every ng time
I can kill hookers and strippers and inhumanly kill things 10/10 best game ever
Game got boring Same thing over and over. I really had an adrenaline rush everytime i got top 5 but now it is just a faint increase in bpm. The game doesn't have enough things going for it that others games like fortnite can't give you. The new map might be good might be terrible but I do not like the sand map so I am probably not gonna be playing at all.
why do i crash when ever i play all other games work fine
Great game and if you enjoy battle royal kinda games it's definitevely worth your money.The developers seem active so more great stuff is to come
10/10 love killing people
good game
Probebly The Best Game Ever Built!
was fun
Its a good game don't get me wrong. But it gets real boring real fast and after how famous this game is right now I feel like it is way too overrated. It's still a great game to play with good friends but not for hours a day... There are so many other games way better than this.
why is this game called rust if there is no rust in it
Take Two ruining games ( Only reason to have on PC and Take Two legally s that reason.
One of the funniest games i have play. Perfect controls and extreamly funny to play with or without friends.
I used to play this game when the developer didn't add all the stupid updates... I can't even get into a game because it always crashes and if I somehow do the lag is insane and I would have to turn the graphics down to as low as I can. Bring back old version
"Product received for free. Fun game but it's missing an proper comp system. Just like the ""big"" games have like League of Legends. Now its just a survivor rank that changes too many times in my opinion. And they should add a system were you get lobby's based on (the killers) level(s) for example it (could) happen that a killer is rank 1 (highest rank) and a new survivor joins the lobby at rank 20 (lowest rank) and it's his/her first game thats not fair by far the killer would have a huge advantage which can lead to new people rage quiting. (I know the stuggle)After all it's a great game and i definitly recommend buyer it!8.5/10 would juke the killer again."
I just spent two straight hours screaming at my monitor in what can only be described as hat wearing goal scoring monster truck ecstasy.
Boooring!! A lot of Hckers !!
Let this be a lesson to not with your fanbase. I will not be giving Take Two any money until they do a complete 180 on their stance on modding and formally apologise to modders they took legal action against.
Nice game pretty buged.
Good game.............
"As with every GTA title to date It's been made to impress and does exactly that. The single player campaign is flawless and deserves an expansion since the characters were too funny and that'll be that. Beutiful graphics too 10/10 there no doubt about it and i'm not even running full spec settings!!! still looks amazing.But with all good things it must unfortunately come to an end.....If you are buying this game for it's online features I wouldn't recommend it to anyone despite all it's posh new stuff.There are multiple reasons for it too For starters the community is very much toxic and it's favourite word is ""noob"".....big suprise....people also like to trash you're vehicle repeatedly kill you for no apparent reason and then ofcourse there's the modders which is fair enough game has mods both SP and MP ones but the hackers/modders have found a way to spawn money ontop of you which sounds as pleasant as can be......then you'll get banned.....120% true stuff.But why so many hackers/modders? i'll tell you why too.It's because alike what happens with every ""Pay for just about everything"" franchise........it already has a cancer rotting and festering within' it...........They call this cancer.....SHARK CARDS!!!! A legal way for already rich millionaire dev's to fleece you for everything you got cause you like to drive cars that look cool and be one of life's ""big boys""......The hardline reality being that not everyone has this limited cache of real life money much alike everything is stupidly high priced to buy ordinarily on this game now. Even by grinding missions you're talking months to get and upgrade 1 vehicle because they made those a wreck too reducing actual rewards and then ramping up prices in game items.......So based on the fact that a lot of people don't have that endless time or money available what other choice do they have apart from to hack? ofcourse...........you guessed it!!!! &lt it's SHARK CARDS... 70 $150 of real life money (more than some average in a week pay).........for 8 million gta cash.........ummmmmm no.........that doesn't sound right.......cause paying that much and recieving that much might upgrade you a single car or 2 at the absolute maximum not taking into consideration all the other fabulous new features that are always just out of reach unless you can whip up plenty and lots of ker ching!!!!!So nope............pants nada..........not recommended.R* have messed this game up completely by over pricing everything it's just not worth it..."
i like discovery things but once you find all the unknown that is it. hopely once early access over might be adding some more things to do.
30$ HAHAHAHAHA I WILL NEVER BUY FOR 30% this game full bags HAHA

SOOOOO MUCH FUNNNNNNNNNNN
GOOD GAME
Good Game
Game is good.
I like this game
Brilliant game other than the PvP aspect of the game unless you have a 5+ man clan for a solo player you really should go on PvE servers to enjoy the game fully.Edit The price has gone up by almost double its asking price this is way too much in my opinion for the type of game it is this doesnt make the game worse i just think Facepunch may be making a simular mistake to the ARK developers. Then again...Rust doesnt have overpriced DLC with it.
This game has more hackers in it than CS S had in its prime. Bluehole company says they're doing something about it but the proof is in the pudding. No thanks. I'm all PUBG'd out.
Matchmaking is so awful after a while. It's not wonder people get so many smurfs on this game. Unplayable after a while. Just look at my hours. Painful after the last 700
Take Two has really shot themselves in the knee here with the whole Open IV situation. This... this is not okay!

The best game you can play because its fun with friends lol +)))
Thanks to console peasants for beta testing 6/5 #pcmasterrace #kappa
PROS addictive tons of depth lots of different weapons types with unique playstyles multiplayer is fun bosses are challenging but rewarding crafting system is good graphics are nice mods are supportedCONS hitboxes can be buggy at times cant skip cutscenes dialogue can get annoying cant customize characters body (only face/hair)
The ONLY reason I bothered wanting GTA V for the THIRD time on PC was for the mods and now TakeTwo is deciding to over the modding community!? This is a sad time in gaming history. I'm incredibly worried about the new Red Dead now. One of my favorite franchises is now being held hostage by a greedy corporation so that we can get what? A load of micro transactions shoved down our thoats? No if you haven't already DO NOT buy this game or support this corporate greed take a stand people!
I have been playing this game for over 20 hours and have experienced a certain number of issues and bugs. My main issue is that every time I drop into the game the map doesn't fully load and a lot of textures and buildings are missing. It takes about two minutes for the game map to load in and by that time other players have the opportunity to collect loot while I sit there and wait. It isn't just my game either other players have posted on forums that they have the same issue. I asked my friend who has played the game longer than I have and has told me many players have the same issue. He gave me a few methods to try and solve this issue but none of them has worked. I hope that this issue gets fixed but until then I am going to stop playing this game until I see more improvements.
It's decent
hey now ur a rocc star
The Best SandBox game in 2015 year
This is probably the game that has given me most for my money and I don't see myself ever deleting it off my computer. Moreover everyone of my friends who have tried it became hooked. They are always constantly updating the game with free content and it 0% pay to win. There's absolutely no advantage gained by purchasing the DLCs and the trading options makes it so that one can simply trade crates for the stuff one craves to pimp the rides up. What surprises me the most is the fact that I completely suck at this game despite over 600 hrs of playtime and yet I love it. I recommend that you give it a try there's always the refund option if it's not your flavour.10/10 no doubt.
vam mater jer su vam serveri gori nego da ti se tetka posere na picu punu smrdljivih dlakavih govana jer ste skrti i ne zelite jebeno kupiti bolje servere
Amazing game to play but if you have a short temper I would not recommend this game for you. If you are lucky you can find some small servers with all friendly people who help out. But if not you're most likely to get stoned to death or shot to death. Very realistic it is like a revamped minecraft. My tips to you is that if you don't want to be killed don't kill other people to give them a reason to do the same.Edit 12/26/14After they released the new version of Rust it has gone downhill.Edit 2/22/15The new version is actually now becoming pretty damn good. A few more major updates and it might be as good as legacy.Edit 4/24/15The new version has gotten very fun. It still has some performance issues but changing the settings fixes that.Edit 11/28/16Just doing this to get a badge.Edit 3/3/18This game is trash.
The game litteraly crashes multiple times per game.

best game eva
better on pc!
I didn't think I would like this game a lot but it turned out very very interesting despite being seemingly repetitive I find myself returning to it. What surprised me even more is that the nervousness never goes away even after 40 something hours I still feel nervous playing it as a survivor.
its very good harder to control on pc as an console user but im getting used to it
Great game spent 2 days downloading and redownloading from bugs then when theres no bugs it doesnt load. 10/10

Graphics 8.5/10 Looks good on Ultra but it takes probably 6+GB of VRAM and a GOOD GPU to run on Ultra. Performance/Optimization 7/10 Not that bad honestly Ive played games much worse optimized like Neverwinter for example. I can run Medium at 60 FPS with a GTX 1060 3GB and 8GB RAM.Connectivity/Lag 9/10 I hear alot of complaints about this game being buggy and laggy as hell. Havent seen anything like that on PC yet. Xbox version is horrendous though. Ive CTD once in 35 hours of gameplay.Gameplay 9/10 Enjoyable wish custom games were expanded upon. I personally wouldnt play this solo most of the time as it is just so much more fun with friends.TL DR Decent graphics less than average optimization infrequent lag or ctd extremely enjoyable with friends less so solo.
If your a weeb who has never seen a doodle this is the game for you you'll be chasing after many countless doodles thats blowing in the wind then realizing that there kids and not long after the cyber police are at your door and saying your under arrest for child pornography so you quickly reach for your gun and body pillow and squeeze but from playing this game for so long you dont have the strenght to pull the trigger far enough back and is too late and is taken under custedy.This is a true story of my friend Kakashi (steam profile) who has been a victim of this game and has been caught many times please put a end to this game so it can help his addiction Thank You.
"I'd like to get a refund but i can't becasue i have more than 2 hours. But there are many reasons i have found which made me want to refund it. 1. the game is very difficult to do it's main goal ""Survive"" which is not fun at all. 2.The community on most of the servers is very toxic. 3. i get very low framerate 4. and finally when sometimes i boot into a server or the game in genral it would either take roughly a half hour or crash(i run on simple) So CAN I GET A REFUND YET?"
Just doing this for the summer sale
刚进游戏么得半个小时去吃个饭回来就莫名其妙被封30天 真尼玛草了
It's really fun game for both side.In Survivor side we could get fun from horor escape matching skill.They also have to get the teamplay. (Sometimes not)In Killer side you can relieve the stress also you can show your inner cruel.Of course it's little bit hard game to people who can play less than 10games but after you got a skill and the rules and many situation you will proud of you that you bought this game.(In my view point blance isn't that bad cuz is up to Killer or map)Most important thing is this game isn't need that much of your computer spec that much.Also this game is less than 5GB. lol (Not sure about GB. Might be less than that)정말 재미있는 게임입니다. 생존자에서 하시던 살인마 역활을 하시던간에 즐거움을 느낄수 있습니다.생존자측에서 플레이 하실경우에 팀플레이와 공포를 느끼시며 게임을 즐기실수 있으며때때로 팀원을 버리는 과감한 선택이 필요하기도 합니다.살인마를 플레이 하실경우 물론 공포감은 없지만 생존자들을 줄여나갈때의 쾌감과 승리를 만끽할수 있는 좋은 게임입니다. 비슷한 게임으로 이볼브가 있지만 이볼브처럼 큰 용량을 필요료 하지도 않으며 속칭 '조선컴'에서도 돌어갈만한 괜찮은 게임입니다.
Really enjoy Rust. It's an open world post apocoliptic survival game full of surprises. 10/10 D
ing h1z1 clone
I have come back to this game time and time again and it still doesn't get old. I could play through it over and over again and still feel as immersed as i was when i first loaded it up after release. From the customization to all of the different storylines to the music. There isn't one thing I disliked about this game.
One of the best Space/Survival games i have ever played!
nice car
different entertaining fun game.
Let's Goooooooo
Shark cards r dum.
A multiplayer game without multiplayer by the time you realize what a bad state this game is in you are way past the refund mark.Aside from all the multiplayer problems theres dozens of other problems that completely ruins this experience.Stay away.
amazing game ruff around the edges. but you'll be fixed to the screen for days
so much bags and low fps is hard to play....
I lai dis gam u shuld buy
Cool.
Why doesn't this game have PS4 controller support? I want to see X Triangle square and circle. i thought this game was made for playstation as well you think it would have the option to use the controller. Other then that its an awesome game.
much played very fun lots of fly wow!
The game is a good game put the last update that made the old rust go a way made me mad I had 428 hours on it so to the people that did that you why did you do that now I don't what to play this game now I don't.
Product received for free. i like this game period
Yea.
Likes It's very fun.Dislikes Everyone is better with me.You should buy this game if your'e good at Rocket Leagye.
Well made game that is very engaging. The sky is the limit for DLC and competitive. Great community. A+ All around!
funny
"I understand that this game is still early access and will have bugs but the bugs that can change the outcome of a game need to be fixed immediatley and I will not reccomend this game until so. Not to mention the unjust bans of players apparently ""Stream Sniping"" for just killing a streamer with absolutely no proof except for the word of the streamer. Until these issues are resolved I will not reccomend this game.List of some game changing bugs Silent cars Invisible walls fliping cars Textures not loading making it impossible to loot or just get into houses in general Bullet proof water Crouch Jumping through windows that other wise are impossible to jump through"
Rust is a great game that I have thoroughly enjoyed playing over the last three months since i have purchased it however there are some aspects of the game that are very irritating as well as some information on the store page that is quite misleading to say the least.Lets begin with the positives. The game is very fun to play particularly if you have another friend or two to play it with. The community is also not too bad not the worst or best that i have ever seen. However be careful of who you trust in this game cause not everyone is friendly but there is the odd few who you can trust and maybe join forces with. When you get started in this game there really is no limit to what you can do.The negatives that i have is the crappy optimisation of the game more specifically the fact that the game is plagued with a memory leak that eats up all of my 8gb ddr3 RAM making multitasking on my pc an impossibility so checking discord is a no can do unless of course you want to wait forever and risk crashing the game. This RAM issue is very common and leads me onto my second point which is the minimum system specs that facepunch has advertised for rust. More specifically the RAM requirement which states 8GB but not whether you should have DDR3 or 4. I can answer that question very easily it CANNOT RUN on 8GB DDR3 it has been a pain in the for me running this game and apart from chopping wood mining and crafting anything else is verging unplayable especially when there is such a heavy emphasis on combat in this game so you can't really play the game if every time somebody shoots you your game becomes a power point presentation. I can however run on 8GB DDR4 ram according to my friend so if you have that no problem however i would severely recommend upgrading your ram and/ or mobo (if cpu needs replacing).In conclusion i like this game it is really really fun (when it works) however i regret buying it without looking into it more or upgrading my specs beforehand and honestly i would like them to make the game more reliable especially for the money that you have to pay for it now.
funnnnnnnnnnnnnn
tons of fun and laughs
Every time you get on the game gets even better because you are able to do new things like airials. After countless hours on the game and even after finishing all of the acheivements and grand champ being achieved this game has never seemed old to me. I recommend if both for casual and serious play. The community is great (with few exceptions) and new things are being added all the time. Both playing and trading up to that item that you wanted for so long has helped this game be able to pull off such a weird idea and make it into one of the top selling games.
So much better than any other survival game in steam.
buggy mess
Abolutely toxic community. I like to think that the community that populates a game is a reflection of the game itself like what it has to offer how the mechanics affect gameplay etc. In the current state this game rewards violence as the ONLY mean of making progress which I really hope it's not what the devs had in mind.The tactic everyone follows is Manage to survive until you find a nice place to build your base start getting weapons and prepare to wreck some asses (if yours hasn't been wrecked already) wreck some asses and dominate the zone get tired of the game because now you have a massive unraidable base and start to kill on sight becoming the predator that once chased you when you were starting repeat. I think I will be giving this game some more time to be developped and I hope devs find a way to balance gameplay and progression because now this is literally nerve wrecking. Maybe in one year or two...
Great game and one i have been looking for for a long time. love that you can play either slow or fased pased. I recomend this to everyone as playing in a 4 man team is a blast. This is what wildlands should have been like!
Rust is one of my favorite games but man it has its issues. This game is so unbalanced that its nearly impossible to play solo on a vanilla server and if you dont start on wipe day you're screwed. You could build a giant base with 20 airlocks to the lootroom but with the twig update a few c4 can completely screw you over. The community is horendous. Its nearly impossible to befriend anyone since the majority of the playerbase are backstabbing 12 year olds. I would recommend this game ONLY if you play on modded servers. With the current state of the game vanilla servers are practiacally unplayable on vanilla.
i am part of the omish mafia now
Review update 5/16/15The game has changed and Rockstar Games has cleared up confusion on mods on GTA V pc i assure you SP mods work fine and will NOT get you banned however ANY mods in multiplayer will get you banned from the game(i still think this is bad but i can see where they are coming from) anyways i have been a big gta fan since early 2003 and cannot fathom anymore at how great the series is i have played all including gta 5 on XB360 XB1 and now at glorious 60FPS 1080p on my pc i will recommend this game to anybody looking for a sick game to do fun things in and very fun to play with friends.
Product received for free. Same great game with nicer effects. Got a free upgrade. I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews.
Biggest scam on steam ever waste me 200
i have ben baned for big donation i donated 1800 usd in gta online and week after i have ben baned rockstar unban me pls #rocstarunban
Product received for free. Love the game been playing it quite a bit still suck at it but i love it i'd recommend the game if you like pvp and base building
I cant llaunch the game i just bought it today and looked up quite a few vids nothing i did worked it just said running and nothing happened
Well..what can I say this game is a masterpiece i've only played for an hour but it didn't take me long to realise how amazing this game really is. It's like minecraft with mods...But better because it's realistic and it has amazing graphics (doesn't really bother me what graphics are like). I 100% reccommend this game because it's fun to play with friends and the overall gameplay is just amazing buy it if you wanna have fun. And of course it's only early access but i'm sure the future updates will make it even more amazing than it already is. 10/10 get this game 3
Capcom quality servers...
Great game
The servers for Oceania are dead I refunded 21 minutes to find a game
Its aight

As a fan of the series since Vice City I found the single player aspect a lot of fun. The lead characters are entertaining the detail of the world is incredible and the missions are generally great especially the big heists. However the online component of GTAV is simply a disaster. It seems obvious Rockstar is far more interested in getting people to buy Shark Cards and pay for premium vehicles bizarre clothing and weapon skins than making sure it's a well managed and competently crafted experience. I'm not against paying a little extra to customize a character's online appearance but you've got to put a reasonable amount of effort into making sure the core gameplay isn't broken before expecting myself and others to pony up extra which is obviously their expectation. My advice Next time don't bite off more than you can chew. Most of these troubles could have been avoided with better planning and putting some effort into maintaining a decent relationship with the player community. Here's a wacky idea Maybe release a single player game (with mod support) and online game (properly supervised) separately.
I do not support Blue Hole suing Epic because people like their game better.
Game has big performance issues and many glitches. Even my friend with a high end PC has tons of issues. My game constantly freezes and buildings don't render in for the first 5 minutes making me unable to play the game for the most part. Even after multiple updates they still haven't addressed our issue. But they did come out with cosmetics so we can give them more of our money. Don't buy into this fraud another early access scam.
The single player is all kinds of fun but the multiplayer has been turned into a grindfest due to the greed of Take Two &amp Rockstar. If you have a patience of a saint and no real life job you might be able to grit your teeth and power on through to open up all the content but for most people with real world commitments you're going to have to buy shark cards if you want to experience all GTA Online has to offer. Everything has a cost. Want a fully upgraded car? That's an extra couple of hundred thousand. Want to grind missions? You'll burn through ammo and armour. Want access to the latest content? That's a cool 1.5 million ish to gain access to facitlities needed to launch it all.There's a reason Rockstar are now offering up a starter pack for 39.99...
Best Game i have purchase so far.looking foward on GTA 6 D
Nice survival game
The Campagne is the best part of Grand theft auto 5 its is very long and has allot to offer and on the Multiplayer side im not 100 percent pleased with it becuase it can get boring easy but I defently recomend having it in your steam libery XD
trASH GAME
This review took me almost 2 years to write and was delayed 3 times.
yeni şasi seçenekleri olsa daha iyi olurdu
so many hackers in the game...
Worth the wait. Would wait again. 9/8
Great game fun interactive multiplayer gameplay with good mix of fast paced action and stealth. Some salty plebs dislike this game because their broken builds got nerf but dont let that discourage you
什么垃圾服务器 育碧土豆还强一万倍 piece of sh 1t
my game is stuck on launcher i have requested a refund
TAKE TWO RUINED THIS GAME!!!!!
Better now
Maybe the greatest RC Soccer game of all time. Duh. 11/10
A day in the life of GTA Online 1. Rob convenience store.2. Clerk pulls a gun and gets shot for his trouble.3. LSPD goes full Dorner on me and I have to flee.4. Escape via submarine with the $1500 I got from the heist.5. Contemplate the meaning of it all while on the bottom of the sea.Solid port and it runs amazingly well. Remapping controls can be a bit daunting at first but you only need to do it once.This is without a doubt the definitive version.
fun game
always idiots ing hacking!!!!! ing shacking never stops
I HAVE VIDEO OF PEOPLE CHEATING AND HACKING HE HAD A MAP AND IT SHOWED WHERE HIS ENIMIES WAS HOW DO I SEND TO THE CREATERS ISTANLEY1229 GMAIL.COM
I really enjoyed this game for the amount of time i have played this.
Take Two made a big mistake by taking OpenIV offline.
Product received for free. The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Special Edition is a worse version compared to Vanilla one. Pros + Has better textures + They 've corrected previous game mechanic issues like saving a game. What i mean is that in the vanilla version for expample when you ended the game you had lets say 5.000 saves and when you begun a new one you had like 5.001. in Special Edition when you end the game and you have 5.000 saves now when you begin a new game you have actually 0 saves. + They've added the Mod option in the game menu which is very comfortable compared to Vanilla one. + SE now supports 64 bit which means it is in theory capable of loading so much more into memory and in turn that should mean far more epic modsCons The sound quality has been seriously downgraded Vanilla Skyrim has tons of mods compared to SE meaning more choicesNevertheless i do recommend the game. If I gave in Vanilla 20/10 then i should give in Special Edition 8/10.
Much Spoop. Good fun. Play.
It's not fun you just think its fun. Don't buy this garbage mess or any Battle Royale period.

Bluehole
An old but fun game which is updating all the time. The graphics is still really good to this day. The aspect of being free to do whatever you want online is really fun especially with friends. The singleplayer I haven't tried but I have heard it gets more fun the more you play. GTA V is a legend and it will stay a legend. The community is always up too.
Nearing on a Chicken Dinner then eventually getting jumpscared by someone exactly on your face can make you and poop your pants at the same time
Sh*test server ever. Too many hackers. Sh*t optimisation.
Got a rock bashed a guys head in took off pants 9/11 IGN
I don't want to talk about it
It fun at times
Not playable at all.Developers don't care about community.Lots of cheaters. t netcode. t servers.10/10
https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 9u_Nw1l4YjQ&amp t 20snice job guys....
the reason I dont recommend this game is cause of multiplayer.The servers on this game have a great shot of winning a guinnes world record for worst servers in the history of worst servers.Literally EA servers are better than this crap.Also i was in a game where we all had green ping and yet the game was still atrociously laggy.
This game has so much potential but the developers are intent on ruining it. Instead of fixing the myriad of issues like bad hit registration poor optimization inconsistent early game loadins etc. they continue to try and push paid updates on their player base. I don't want loot crates or paid event passes I want a game that ing works since it's been out of early access for over 6 months. For a company that's made almost a billion dollars in sales you'd think they'd have their priorities straight and put out a decent product. I honestly can't wait for the next BR game to come out that does the hyper realistic style even moderately well because then this game will die as it deserves to since the developers just care about money not a consistent player experience.
10/10 would heist again.
I only have 62 hours on this game and it has already become one of my most favorites.
Nice game!
Social Club is broke
sucks nuts
i can't run this game
Don't buy this game you will get random ban and start your character from the very beginning after you play it for a long time.
Honestly I have nothing bad to say about this game. I've played it for a few extended play periods and I was impressed with how into it I got so quickly. Onny bad thing I have to say about it is that it's a little difficult to master the controls but that isn't too big of an issue.
This is a very challenging game but very fun to play. There is the beginnertime where you aren't that good at the game and might get annoyed quickly but once you get passed that it is an amazing experience every game again. Especially if you play it with friends.
BEWARE BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I can no longer play the game. Every match i get in it crashes. locks up my whole computer. I have to hard reboot every time i try to play. If a game can hijack your computer it should be deleted. This game is evil. cannot get game to play anymore.
this game is fun to pop into random SOS quests and just kill monsters but shines at its best when in a discord with friends having a blast please keep in mind that pc updates come later because capcom isnt used to pc but the updates a re coming i highly recommend 10/10
grind fest10/10 v good gameonline is fun with friendsbut i have no friends (
靠直播的垃圾游戏 大量的外挂 优化十分差 经常出现你掉到地面游戏还没加载好的情况 服务器极其糟糕 没有加速器没法玩的级别 经常出现游戏结束之后无BP结算
Great game to just pick up and play.
OverAll This is a Great survival game and wayy better when you play with friends when I play this im hooked into it and play it non stop it's such a great addicting game. Every time you log out your parinoid while your gone you base will be raided by the lil naked you shot eariler that day. 10/10
Great game but Bluehole need to fix their servers. Start of the game it is like you have 500 ping and you physically cannot do anything. I'd say 50% of games I die to that early game lag.
Such a fun and addictive game I forgot to masturbate.
My friend manipulated me to into buying this game for a full price later I manipulated him into thinking I am Charles Barkley.10/10 would manipulate again
best game UwU
amazing physics
Take Two Interactive is trying to kill one of the key features of PC Gaming starting with a devastating blow to Grand Theft Auto modding. If they start pulling this on all of their owned games then goodbye to modding in Civilization games and Kerbal Space Program.
Through all these years Rocket League still stands as one of the best competitive or even casual games period. While games like Overwatch can become repetitive Rocket League succeeds in remaining fresh till today even though it has a very basic premise. Btw I had to review this to get a steam badge from the steam awards lol
Best game ever
xd
Even though a lot of janky stuff happens in this game and high ping players riddle this game with issues its still an amazing game to play with friends!
just a meme pappa gaben
Rockstar yapmış yine yapacağını.Son yıllarda çıkmış optimizasyonu sağlam hikayesi sağlam en iyi oyunlardan birini yapmış.Oyunda yok yok. Grand Theft Auto serisini sevmeyen bulamazsınız zaten. Bu oyundan sonra eminim seveni dahada artacaktır.Herkes almalı bence.Özellikle online modunda eğlence bol. D
Recommended Awesome Game!
The world of gaming has changed. I feel it in my keyboard. I feel it in my mouse. I see it on my monitor. Games that once was are lost. For none now play who remember them. It began with the forging of the great mods. One was giving to A2 immortal wisest and where it all started. One giving to A3 with great players and craftmanship. And one to KoTK who is gifted to be the newest but who above all else desired money. For within these mods was bound the strength to govern the Battle Royale genre. But they were all of them fools for another game was made. In the land of Steam in the fires of Bluehole the great developer PlayerUnknown forged in secret a master game to control all the other mods and into this game He poured his cruelty His malice and His will to dominate all of gaming. One Battle Royale to Rule them All.. PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds
This game is ing gay and im dong this for the badge.
The game is insanely great however the downturn too many hackers. It will be a good idea if developer able to eliminate them. Effort on updating game is appreciable. Can't wait for new map.
play it it is worth it
service
Only survival game I'll play
I used to really enjoy this game I really did. As glitchy as it was/ still is I had tons of fun playing with friends running away from the killer etc.HOWEVER the balancing for this game is absolute trash. All of the best characters in the game are behind a stupid paywall and there is nothing nice for the people who paid for the base game. After the release of the doctor I just straight up uninstalled the game. I was tired of the absolutely horrid balancing of the game and lack of care that the devs have for their users.I would give this a 4/10 but there will more than likely be another update that will break this broken glitchy game even more than it already is.
In a World where rockstar can make a game work on launch......this is not that world
TOO MANY NORMIES AND FIX YOUR GAME BLUEBALL
i was harassed by a sever admin for over an hour than was kicked for no reason i reported the player and nothing was done.. every sever is the same this game is junk. waste of 82 hours
How to ruin the potential of one of the greatest games ever crafted. Step one Make this game.Step two ???Step three Profit!
Take Two has ruined this game by effectively removing a large amount of mods
chicken dinner
Pretty good survival game
lolo
cars... D 10/10
REGION LOCK CHINA. Game is until it's done.
Product received for free. This is trash
"The concept and the idea although not original it's well put in place tho' &gt Buggy UI from time to time&gt ""Network lag detected"" if it comes on (while in game) it will never come off you actually need to quit the match although you are connected and everything is un synch. This means losing your progress in the current match 10/10.&gt General performance is meh.ALSO &gt Promised bugfixes features and other updates &gt received microtranzactions! &gt bugfixes ""will be delayed next month"" yeah. sarcasm Obviously dev fixed all stuff regarding game performance UI features gameplay so addinng microtranzactions was the next final step /sarcasm ... not.Now dev's whining about someone ""stealing"" PUBG's concept which actually dates back to prehistoric age of gaming 10/10.Worst spent 30euros and 35h of my life uninstalled.Fix your"
best game!
It's like Fifa if ronaldo played on all fours
Grand Theft Auto is an awesome game don't get me wrong but the community is just dog Online for me is a huge no simply because of ers hacking and griefing. Offline however is fun and enjoyable. You can do whatever you want and install mods. If you want Gta V because of online only play with your friends and trusted ones.Conclusuion Get Gta when its on sale or go to Play online only with your friends and trusted ones. Have a beast pc that can run high settings.
我只想说 太多的外挂了官方请你着重的去解决这个好吗 这样让我嘛游戏体验度极差
I dont review things very often but i have been seeing all the hate/negative reviews on here and so i think i need to write a more positive one. It is true that most of the things in the negative reviews are real and people have good right to be frusterated and angry at how everything is going currently. I know it really pisses me off and i think its marketing on their part as ill never buy another game from these guys without a real hard second look as to what im actually getting. All that aside though the game itself is an amazing game there is nothing that compares to pubg in my opinion. As far as the bugs go i feel they have made a fair amount of progress. Sure everynow and then ill have to shoot someone 10+ times to get a kill but that is very rare and stuff like that happens in almost every fps game. Summary If you want a game that is lots of fun that you can play by yourself or with friends and you dont care about having the cooliest outfit and gun skins then i deffinately would recommend this game. Especially with it only being 20$ right now. Its well worth it and who knows maybe one day theyll get their head out of their a** and redo the reward system.
Play with 4 friends all with bloody party streamers ing killer DC during loading screen lose all items ing great game
ing freezing and fps drop after every update
Full of campers lagswitchers and salty people. Just like in real life. 10/10
"Great multiplayer co op survival game but community has ""little"" toxicity. Game has few issues and bugs.Some perks are so powerful that some people climb ranks just because of the perk not by being good.And when skill and those perks combine it's just disgustingly overpowered.But you know I'm HOOKED."
Its soccer with Rc cars. What more could you expect?
The best game that i played in a long time definetly buy it
I've got a FX 6300.Yes it's possible. Having same issues with cities as everyone else.
Game is fun in general. Software needs a lot more optimisation. People that owns better computer have a lot more advantage since they can render everything quickly. Sometimes the game is buggy but it is a lot better than before. If you play in your own region latency is decent. I used to open crates but... since the introduction of keys crates became useless and are only to be sold on the market... The game is not pay to win but actually require skills.I personaly think the business model can be changed. Giving a thumb down because there is no average button. The game can still be improve by a huge margin.
Really nice and fun game to playI'll recommend it to anybody who likes to play good games
This Game Is Like Minecarft And Roblox If It Had A Child I Give It A 420/69Leave a like for dank memes and smash that subscrube button litdanknibba #HEYBETER
I've had every gta game since gta 3. This is the first time that I've seen a company publicly say screw you to the consumers. Everyone here bought the game for the same reason mods. If I wanted to play the boring story mode I would play this on my Xbox. Time to find a new game.
Holy cow!
Ive played this game for quite a long time(259 hours) and it has been a lot of fun but its really not nearly as fun without friends and most of the time people are too incompetent to really help you in a match against killer. Most of the time you will get farmed on a hook and then you'll get downed and put right back up on the same hook you were put on last time. i have a prestige 2 level 30 ish David King (not legacy prestige) and I am not bad at the game (most consider it a respectable amount) but its mostly the teammates that screw you over hiding in lockers when there's a heartbeat not doing generators and walking around when you can see them whilst on hook. And honestly killer isn't the greatest occasionaly you will get a good feeling of killing all four of the survivors but then other times even in really low ranks you will get horrid survivors. Not bad survivors but bad as in evil the survivors then control the game you can't kill them they will outsmart you. Considering im a survivor main this is a huge problem for me and even if i'd like to relieve some stress even killing won't help me. My final statement Its a good game whilst being flawed but if you would not like to be incredibly salty try playing with friends or just watch other's play it take a break.
Salty not good
The game has come a long way. I can now say you get the game worth your money. There has been a lot of optimisation and netcode patches and the game has become stable. Still some room for improvement though.Gameplay wise the third map is on the way and weapons are more balanced than ever and a lot more attachments have been added.
Hackers and a gun game with guns spawning at rare chance
This is one of the best game I've played so far. The story mode is really entertaining and once you finish you can play online with friends or the online community. There are some cheaters on online mode though. You can own apartments houses discos yachts cars helicopters planes and a lot more. You can become a CEO and hire other players to make money and increase your power. I personally recommend the game because it's really well made and has almost no bugs.
fun game but it gets boring fast
Have 350 hours in legacy.I preferred legacy rust.Enough said
This Game Is One Of The Best Even For Just An Alfa Its Basicly The 2 Hit Games Minecraft And Dayz Combined. This Game Is Also Played By A Bunch Of Popular Youtubers So If You Want To See Some Gameplay To Prove This Watch Them Or Others Who Get The Full Experiance. This Game Is Worth The Money But 1 Thing Im Hoping They Add Is A Single Player Gamemode. Okay Youve Read Enough To Know THis Game Is AWSOME!!!!!
Pretty fun lots of grinding in online.
One word Addiction.
I like this game.
Aside from the often occurring disconnects the game is pretty nice.What pisses me off the most is that Michael Myers camps players when they're on the hook. It's impossible for another player to do something while Michael won't move a millimeter. Please nerf that guy when he's playing against inexperienced players
LAG!
This game could be really fun but the cheating has gotten out of control. I can't go a single day without someone wall hacking or aim boting. I would be a die hard fan if it wasn't for all the cheating.
"The following review has been written during a very early early access.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a battle royale third/first person shooter with a semblance of realism behind it. 100 players enter through a plane and only one two or up to four can leave as a winner. That is honestly all you need to know about the game. There is next to no story and even if there is some backstory it is not needed to enjoy the game at all.Lets start with the good stuff The one map that is in the game is fairly large allowing probably even more than just 100 players to get lost in it. The sound system while glitchy is fairly good for a game of this theme. There are some problems but I will explain those in the cons section. Guns sound pretty well explosions are loud and generally the sound is just about right. Movement options are fairly great. Very reminiscent of ARMA 2. The game is really fun with friends. It has potential.Now the bad stuff Gunplay. While semi realistic most of the guns either feel like they lack any punch or they have way too much punch. From my experience there are numerous occasions of shooting someone several times (lets say 12 times with an AKM) and your opponent is still running around as if nothing really happened. And then you have weapons that touch you anywhere and you explode. Feels like the game would be better if it chose either strong weapons but a lot of cover or weak weapons with movement being the most important thing. Right now the weapon you find tends to dictate whether you are gonna have a good time or not. Not your skill. Map design. While I appreciate how large the map is there is a major problem with it. I hope you like to be sniped out of nowhere because that has been about 90% of all of my deaths in this. Players know which weapons need very little to kill you and since the maps are very elevated and scopes are fairly common most of the time you are gonna just shake your head and wish the game had a damage indicator. Shot recognition. While the sound design is generally great being able to tell where you are being shot from (and we are not talking about silencers) is almost impossible. Quite often the sound can be coming from one direction and you are actually being shot from behind. This has been proven by several video makers and streamers with some of the best headsets on the market. Lack of any tactics. Sniper is king in this game. The moment you find a weapon that can take a scope and the aforementioned scope you become the king of the game. This would be ok if you could in some way make sure you gain these. Usually it is entirely 100% random who gets these and if you do not find one in the first 5 6 minutes of the game you might as well disconnect cause that there is game over for you. There are no defensive measures in the game. No mines no traps. Not to mention even the sneakiest movement still makes so much noise that only a deaf person would be caught off guard by you. RNG. If I say that sniper is king in this game then RNG is the queen. The circles are 100% RNG. You may think you have jumped well gained some gear killed some people and then you notice that the circle has moved far away from you and the way towards it is bound to have at least 10 snipers waiting specifically for you. When it happens once you are miffed but its ok. When it happens ten times in a row you really feel like throwing the computer out of the window. Optimalization. As of writing this review the game is barely playable. There are people who can play the game just fine but majority of people with both bad and good RIGs are having trouble playing this game no matter the settings. Again even video makers and streamers with beasts for computers have reported major problems with optimalization. Lets not even mention constant crashes falling through scenery being blocked by invisible walls etc. Lag. As of writing this review majority of people are having major connection issues. Even people with legit really good broadband. For me for instance it is actually better to play on NA server... while I live in Central Europe. Rubber banding will be the death of thee at least a couple of times. Hit recognition is terrible because many times you unload 5 shotgun shots into someone and they kill you with a couple of pistol bullets because on their end you did not hit them and the servers ""decides"" who was right when it synchronizes. Hackers. Anyone willing to look into the darker corners of the Internet can see the market for the hacking tools for this game bearing major fruit. Why? Because it is an early access game that grew way too quickly for it s own good. Not to mention it is made in an engine that is by my knowledge very easy to hack into. It is sad and all we can hope for is that the developer will find a way how to deal with this menace. Right now it is almost more probable to find a hacker than to find a clean player. Rules. Anyone who puts ""These rules are neither final nor exhaustive we reserve the right to suspend disruptive users even if their behaviour doesn t fall under any of the above rules directly.""Is a fake person who just wants to power mongrel other people. Basically the devs are saying they can ban you for anything even nothing at all. Stay away.TL DRGame has a lot of potential if the developer decides to fix the major issues balance the game a little and add to it. It is currently in Early Access so it should not be a problem. I cannot recommend the game in it s state though I will continue playing it because even through all of it s problems it is a fun game with friends."
Fast game you need some skills to play overall a very good game
Good game
+ Satisfying level progression. Some fun gameplay elements (chases jukes). Really fun with friends. Toxic Community. Questionable gameplay mechanics (camping crutch perks). Devs that keeps changing their ideas for this game.At this price this game is worth it.
ban me for ever with no reason
like
this game is hot garbage. pubg came out of early access before rust did and still maintains high player count. if you want a good survival game just go play minecraft ark survival or literally any other survival game you can think of. dont buy it now since its 35 ing dollars. this game is so overpriced its not even funny.
Solid game always fun dont understand the buthurt and the NPC outrage over this game
YOU
11/10 would ign again 3
fat dicc
its ing fun bro
I am not recommending this game for one reason and one reason only Frequent disconnects from their servers. It is horrible. In the middle of fishing with friends? Disconnect.Fighting a wyvern with friends or randoms?Disconnect.Trying to matchmake because you have no friends?Disconnect.There is one thing that I have taken away from this and that is... Error Code 50382 MW1. Get this... Capcom has a fix for it... just go into your router and port foward I dunno.... about 20 different ing ports! Seriously? What's even better The fix doesn't even in work. You will still disconnect mid match or fail at matchmaking harder than you failed your 5th Grade Honors Calculus class. Other than the technical aspects of this game I'm having a blast however that is of course when I can actually play with my friends or the randoms I come across. There are some graphical pop in issues occasionally and the textures are too low res for PC but its all good and goes largely unnoticed during monster fights. If that is one of your gripes. If you aren't like me and are fine rolling solo then by all means buy it and play it to your hearts content.However if you are like me and care about playing with friends then hold off until they have a solid fix. Hope this helps.10 out of 10 wou... Error Code 50382 MW1
no
Very fun with friends
Nice game! But optimize more the game plz!
If you want to play a good single player game with an amazing story and funny characters this game is for you.If you want enjoy a good multiplayer game with alot of updates and no microtransactions this game is not for you. When i first bought this game the multiplayer was amazing you only needed to buy Shark Cards (the in game money) if you wanted a cool new car that would make your friends jealous. Now you NEED to buy shark cards of you want to play the new DLC unless you're a hacker or you just grinded to get alot of money. Its really evident that Rockstar gave up on this game and is just trying to milk whatever money they can get before releasing a new GTA.
"uh used to play it when i got my pc. me and my friends would grind this game all day and not try because it was fun like when we had a strat called ""the car strat"" where we would only get cars and run people over which was really fun. Its just gotten stale and to be honest the game has kinda gone downhill. maybe ill give it another try but just not right now. (im giving it a recomend because theres no in the middle that i can see)"
I have been playing this game for a few years now and it always seems to find a way to suck me back in. 10/10
great fun
Excellent. So intense and so much fun. Still a bit buggy but developpers are working hard and the game is moving fast.First person is also now available that's great.
this game is the worst $30 ive ever spent
1.Great Game Boiz2.Don't listen to butthurt people about them getting banned3.The online is never jam packed with s4.BUY THIS GAME5.That's about all I can review oh wait.....DLC is amazing6.#CowChop7.You still haven't bought the game?
per game ever y e a
Worst port 2k18
"Far too much of this game is based on random chance what I mean by that is on your screen you shot the guy first on the server you did not you missed he heard your shot he now sees you he turns and shoots you once with a shotgun and you die. Even though you shot him two or three times first with your shotgun in the chest that is where you aimed you did not because there servers are so bad you actually hit him only once in the hand and he took almost no damage. This game has a great concept derived from the Japanese movie ""Battle Royale"" but it seems the programmers just aren t good enough to make this a ""playable"" game. I bought this game because it was a great concept with the hopes that it would one day be good. This has not come to be and I cannot recommend it to anyone unless you enjoy getting very frustrated."
Overall my experience has ranged from chill to heart racing cortisol pumping panic. Loot raw chicken breast from dead bears while you desperately search for just one more pile of wood.. always one more. Depending on the server you may have the island to yourself or be forced to face countless bandits as well as those that seem to simply watch the world burn although so far nothing can actually be set on fire aside from the one torch you spawn into the game with.It's still in Alpha so there are some rough edges which is to be expected. Even so it's a fantastic game IMO. 10/10 would buy again.
I have fun playing it.....
game
One of the best game of the 20th century. Go ahead if you are still not sure. But I highly recommend you to play with a controller (Xbox or DS4). Becareful of the community it's one of the most toxic I've seen so play with friends and you'll have lot of funs.
this game got for no mods
"Singleplayer is amazing. The story characters map. Even after playing over and over again it's still entertaining. I like it way more than the GTA 4's story.As for online this is the reason why I don't recommend the game because I think that most people nowadays buy the game mainly because of the online. Don't get me wrong I used to love it played over 400 hours of pure online everything was awesome I thought that this is the perfect multiplayer game they are constantly updating it and there is a lot of stuff which has become the problem. A year and a half ago everything was more or less balanced the prices were reasonable. After the Import/Export things were getting drastically different. Looked like this to me ""Hey buddy want to enjoy the content? Well you should get our brand new garage only for 2M.""Then Gunrunning. Again my overall feelings ""Look at this cool update! The players will be able to get their bunkers only for 1.5M. Also don't forget to upgrade your equipment for another 1M. Did we forget to mention that getting additional people working for you will only cost you half a million? By the way you will time from time get raided and lose everything unless you buy another cameras for 400K! All the raids will magically disappear! Want to modify your weapons in your Workshop? Well too bad you need a trailer for that but don't worry it's only 1 to 2 and a half millions. Do you want to train your shooting? There you go only for 700K! Do you prefer white over black? The paint costs 105K so... Did we mention that you can take a nap there? The key for that room costs 265K. Do you want a Gun Locker which you will probably never use? That will be 175K. You want some caddies? 85K or 120K if you want to have them larger. Don't forget to check out the new cars! Get yourself a car that shoots a couple of missiles only for 4 5M!""How I felt about Smuggler's Run Hello there! This update will be about planes. Want a hangar? 1 to 5M. Which style would you prefer? The one for 100k or the one for 320k? Want different lights? No problem the more expensive style you chose the more expensive lights you'll get! Isn't that cool? Want some nice 'art' on the floor? Sure we'll paint it for you costs only up to 200k just like your apartment you bought last year to do heists! Furniture? You mean another wall? That's another 280k for you. Again want the keys to access your bed? 235k 375k. You want to customize your 500k glider? One word WORKSHOP! And guess what this number 1 150 000 means... Correct! It's the price!""The prices of the content added were skyrocketing if you wanted to truly enjoy the game you had to either make money all day long if you wanted to be a fair dude that doesn't hack which is by the way another big problem with this game or buy some cards that are horribly overpriced. At this point I didn't have time to play all day long I didn't want to hack and I totally didn't want to spend twice the price of the game on some cards so I stopped playing. Since then I've been ignoring the game not watching any videos and not paying attention to the updates. Sometimes when I notice that there's an update I come back for a couple of minutes and look how a vehicle with a couple of missiles costs over 4 millions. Now another heist update you might think this ""Oh finally another heist things are getting back to the state when you could buy a house for 200k and get full content.""The reality however looks like this ""Hey it's nice to see you back in the game look at this brand new heist room only for 2 millions the same idea only way more expensive.""And as a person who doesn't have that much time to play anymore I can't enjoy the content anymore. Another problem with this game are the hackers. I finally am thrown into a lobby after 10 minutes of loading I see that I am immediately teleported to an airport from my house with a couple of other people and I am stuck doing some rather strange animations. I always report the guy when I find out who it is but it doesn't seem to help. I've heard some heartbreaking stories of people getting banned for no reason this luckily hasn't happened to me yet."
The best if not only Carball simulator. Pros Hundreds of hours of gameplay and lots of modes to play. Great learning curve you can feel yourself progress every time time you play. DLC is purely cosmetic. Doesn't require a supercomputer to play. Huge player base and cross network play with PS4 players. Great controller support Split screenCons Crates are now pay to open. Servers can sometime be overloaded and cause lag.Rocket League is one of those staple games that anyone with a PC or Console should own. Matches are only 5 minutes and yet they are so much fun. You can jump in for a quick fix or most likely get trapped into the 'One more game' loop and play for hours. An almost perfect game.
exhilarating and immersive 9/10
i love this game jon snow lives
hej j e b e m
good game
this game is fun but it really doesnt give youy anything to shoot for as far as earning for your avatar as far as rewards go
"Have play this game in my Friend's HousePretty awesomeCant play in my home Because of an Unsolve ing problem""Display Driver has stopped working and has been recovered""Please contact me if you know how to solve this masterpiece of errors"
Take Two interactive is a company who has decided that mods are now illegal even though rockstar 100% endorses modding. OpenIV is now banned via Take Two and modding is what makes this game worth it in the long run so no. Until take two changes expect to see a lot of gta games being downvoted to oblivion
fix your game! trash only crashes!!!
Pretty Good gets a bit repetetive after a while but good
it's good
So far ive played the game for over 20 hrs and all i can say is WOW! This game is fun challenging and super rewarding. The only reason for these negative reviews are for the network issues which can always be fixed with a simple patch. While it hasn't be perfect for me it doesn't even come close to affecting my view on this game. Truly a fantastic game that you'll lose track of hours. I know I did )
reccomended!
Product received for free. Hmm what to say here. Take a 5 year old game and give it a new coat of paint and a new engine. That pretty much sums up this version of the game. If your used to playing the game modded your likely to end up disappointed. However now that Skyrim is on a 64 bit platform the new mods for the game will have far less constraints. If you have an unmodded save however you can directly copy the save into this version and it will work. Honestly asking if you like this version is the same as asking what your favorite color is. Skyrim is still skyrim and personally I like that I can now dump more then 4GB of memory into the application. Besides that I havent really noticed much difference.
i think that awesome
Fun with friends not so much alone
Not for me.
Great concept! However a lot of optimizations are needed. Then again we are still in the beta phase.
fun game for playing with friends
game community and servers. The community is full of roof campers shooting anyone at all including me and my friends just starting out. So much lag that my friend told me I died 30 minutes later I was still running and then out of nowhere dead. Bought it on Humble for cheap regretting that decision.
This game is not what I expected. The UI is clunky the combat feels stiff and trying to play with your friends is a nightmare. Not only that but after the 6 months that Capcom had to port this to PC the game is liable to crashes and some of the options are restricted (as per the other reviews). I can't recommend this game for it's sale price either wait until it's on sale or when most of the issues are fixed.
зайдешь лутше купить консоль
I used to be a big fan of this game. I bought it on Xbox 360 for the single player Xbox One for the online with friends and then a third time here for mods. I know many other people who have done the same thing. Apparently $200 isn't enough so now they're taking the mods away. If I could refund the PC version now I would. All in all this version looks like it's turning into a waste of $60.
sh!t
Now you too can be part of the wild Dindu tribes!
I have 757 hours in this game and have stopped playing it and probably won t go back to it either why?1. Weapon change update completely destroyed the game what s the point of ARs? A UMP will destroy you at range with its non existent recoil even with no attachments. 2. Buggy lobby for some reason my friends couldn t see me online for months and I couldn t invite them to the group. This happened to a few us once again for months.3. The servers are laggy some games felt like you were 2 seconds behind everyone.4. Constant FPS drops and performance issues especially during event modes.Sadly I can see PUBG coming to an end even the more popular streamers are slowly moving onto other games. Anyways that s my two cents.
Product received for free. Excellent game is fun D up to unfairness in teammates but it is possible to survive and this is probably the best game to open the game because in this game you have probably the greatest chance to get something
I cant reccomend this game after 140 hours the story mode is good but can get boring. In online mode there is way to many hackers and i dont think the devs do anything about it the only thing the've done is take away 7 million of my hard earned dollars for no reason which is stupid.
Product received for free. Everybody stop complaining about stuff you knew was true before you bought the game. Even though you probably got it for free. If you haven't bought skyrim buy this game it's amazing. There are just a bunch of salty kids who wanted bethesda to remake morrowind but that would've taken years to do.
"The game is pretty fun MOST of the time. The objective is simple enough for whoever you decide to play. If you are a survivor you try to fix the generators and survive until the doors open which you then proceed to escape. As a killer you try to hunt down the killers and sacrifice them on hooks to the ALMIGHTY SPIDER GOD (AKA The Entity).I can recommend this game if there is someone who wants to have a horror themed kind of game with a cooperative and competitive mix of gameplay its pretty simple and fun. Different survivors killers and perks relating to each one can give you different kinds of builds and strategies depending on what you build.The downsides are...pretty bad at least right now. The major problem is that there are only a few INCREDIBLY GOOD MUST HAVE perks that you will see majority of players running while other perks are okay situational or outright useless. Another problem which is pretty much the fault of the players who do this killers who will camp hooks and ruin another player's game. This problem is countered with ""Yeah but the other survivors can just work on generators and get an easy win "" BUT this doesn't excuse the fact one survivor is still having his game ruined by someone who wants to be garbage to someone. Finally this is a personal complaint (And some people will disagree which is fine) but I feel using the Mori killer offerings (Or anyway to instantly kill survivors without hook) are just too easy of a way to get an edge on the survivors.Despite my complaints I still have fun with the game most of the time and would recommend checking it out."
The game is really good but can be difficult and annoying for new players
Don't buy this game It's great don't get me wrong.I can only sum this up in one way when you run from a nade and are about to kill the mofo that threw it at you and the game crashes for noooooooooooooo ing reason you know you should stay away till they fix there
I am a sheep.
i swear everyone who kills me is a hacker10/10
Ocasional bugs and gripes aside you will keep coming back for more. And more. And more.And then youll stop for a week because of that one dude who killed you from a moving vehilce at 100 meters thanks to a lucky spray from a m4.And then youll come back for more.
Game is very cool but a lot of glitches
Great game with new gameplay but there's too many hacker in this game
new review no this isn't about stream snipingafter giving this a positive review in june I completely changed my opinion on this game and realized how ing boring it actually is after playing around 25/31 hours of this game trying to get ingame currency for steam market money. this is still better than h1z1 guns hit where you aim them but that's not why this game is boring as hell. item distribution is awful and if you want to play safe you basically get nothing and you're forced to drop into a city which if you're a new player you'll get killed in. trial and error right? maybe if you don't have anything else to do with your life cause AFTER you're out of a game you have to go through three loading screens a &lt short&gt queue another loading screen wait for people to load in wait for the plane to go above your preffered landing spot and fall. now the ingame UI is good but the menu looks and has animations that look like something made for a school project why don't the devs invest in making the game FASTER and better looking instead of adding new weapons that you never get to pick up or fog that barely shows up in any matches?June 2018 update bought the event pass and didn't receive an item from a challenge a week after completing it. support didn't reply yet. this game lost like 2.5 mil concurrent players it's not going to last by the end of the year and to anyone who wants to buy this knockoff fortnite battle pass DO NOT do it it's a SCAM and a WASTE OF MONEY
AWESOME GAME!
Product received for free. Great game

"I've owned this game for several years now and from the start it has been a constant love/hate relationship. Over the years the changes made have both confused and excited me but sitting as is in it's released state I would say we are in a great place. Building is still hands down the best building any survival game has to offer. People are generally toxic unfortunately but meeting those select few has created friends that I think very highly of. Enjoyment is entirely what you are willing to put into this game and it definitely does have its moments of absolute ""I'M DONE AND CANNOT PLAY THIS ANYMORE! UNINSTALL!"" but getting the bow kill on a geared guy causing chaos to some nakeds will ALWAYS trump that feeling. Buy the game it's worth the money."

Love this game. It has some things to improve upon but the fun of playing both sides helps letting those things slide untill their fixed.
good game its very good
nothing is better than driving around and listening to backstreet boiz songi rated it 5/7 and dont forget about tracey's moans at home
"I have played for 500+hrs and maybe around 100+ on test server. I can say this is one of the best games ! Honestly 1.0! AMAZING! Hands down.Don't let the reviews scare you. This is my honest feeling about the game.Solo Can be challenging You either die within the first 30sec or you end up killing some poor soul that is trying to enjoy the game but you ended up gunning him down anyways. So you made it past the first 2 min gun shots are popping off near you. People do one or two things.. 1) Aggressive player Follows the gun shots and attemps to kill everyone around ( About 15% of the people who try this can do it) 2) House Keeping The guy that waits till gun shots stop and goes in to clean the guy looting .. (Enough said with that one) Now at this point you are either in the Zone or Driving/Running to the Zone.. Those Driving or running 50% end up getting shot and killed. The other 50% make it to the middle of the zone camp in a house or are out looking for kills.After flipping your car.. Running a guy down Gunning someone down.. you are in the Top 10 and either you get picked out by a sniper or fragged... RIP... Chicken Dinner !! You won your first game.. Congrats.. you got 1kill ... Duo You cannot go wrong with Duo's .. The amount of enjoyment in duo is legit over 9000!! You guys play together calling shots kill everyone the millitary base! Load out with Silence M4 lvl 3 gear Both got a Kar98 8x Silenced man! life is good! Bang bang! you guys killing it both got 9 kills each reaching the end of the zone! Chicken Dinner.. EZPZ if you got a good friend or team8 its legit amazing!! ORYall s*** and ... well you know you made it half way but didnt win.. Don't worry keep at it legit everyone can get a win... okay not everyone..Squad Where do you start man... its so fun! gun shots everywhere 4 squads landing at the same spot! granades flying Bullets Smokes Beating people down with your fist or a PAN!! amazing. You got that one guy on your team.. he doesnt know how to drive so gets all you killed!! Then you make it and there is people already camping the middle of the circle! your team rolls up and just get's LIT UP! no return.. lol.. OR you and your friends actually good and take them out! ... Either way you guys are going to have so much fun.. But sometimes you got that one guy in your team and you guys are on discord flaming each other ... lul ( We do this all the time) But legit fun!I have shot a guy mid air with a Kar98 while he was doing a flip on a bike.. I have also shot a guy inside the 5th seat aiming down the bridge (fkn bridge campers) with a K98 + 8x while car moving!Legit I flipped crashed into a tree blew up my 4man squad.. Had my Retardo team8 shot our team8 while he was down begging for help.. lmao.. ( After he killed him"" DUDE! i didnt know that was you!) Back flipping on a bike with your friend! Landing on a roof top! Done that! had a 8 man fist fight! its an experience ...Hacker's In all my hours on PUBG ( I only play NA) I have encounter i want to say 10 ? maybe less than 15 hackers.. I can't speak for all regions but NA I haven't seen a lot. Although.. its really annoying when you do get killed by one.This is my opinion on the game. I have had a lot of fun and a lot of games.. but you know it happens. I have gotten a lot better &amp I plan on enjoying the rest of the game. See you guys on 1.0 ! (sorry for my spelling mistakes I did see a few of them but honestly im sittinng here watching netflix at 1 30ish AM and I am not about to go back an correct them... Sorry lmao. I am lazy AF right now. ) Hope i helped at least 1 person if not then.. welph... Worth the try I love/hate the game."
A rather epic RPG that has better graphics than the last. I give it a 9.5/10
tacos. I like them.
Really impressed with this little program. The default wallpapers are nothing special but there are tons of free wallpapers available in the steam workshop. I have dual monitors and I can have seperate wallpapers on each. You can make playlists so the wallpapers cycle at timed intervals and a lot of the wallpapers can be customised with speed colours etc. Some wallpapers contain clocks and an audio triggered visualisation (one of these kept crashing my PC so be aware of that). Doesn't seem to use many resources even on high settings. The only downside is that using a 1440p monitor the content available is a little limited but over time more content should be available for this format. I found using 4k content or in some cases 1080p it looks good still. Well worth the price.
JANNNKYYYYYYYYY!!!!
Stop reading reviews and buy this game already
Product received for free. I didn't really look forward to Skyrim SE thought it was just gonna be Skyrim with some graphics mods but I was nicely surprised.It's way better optimized animations are a ton smoother and also it runs on 64 bits now so this allows for bigger mods and has better support for new rigs.
Nice.
Love this game. That is all.
This Game Is Epic.
I wanna the ones who created this game... Just saying.69/10
Fun game
It is a fun game for the first hour then you will never play it again... it should be free not $20
It's gr8!
Fun game but VERY BAD EU Servers crashes every 2nd match.
sezzion sucks
piece of game always crashes not worth the 30 dollars and i cant get a refund for playing less than an hour either not recommended
Great game in the GTA franchise
I hate any company not allowing mods. Mods drastically increase their revenue and surely that is surpassing the few dollars that they lose from those 10 people buying their overpriced cash cards.
Game is amazing. Lots of fun. As far as the people complaining about lag spikes and fps drops. The game is still in EARLY ACCESS and the game is nowhere near complete. Yes they maybe adding crates and paid keys right now but these do not affect the gameplay. They are only cosmetic items and if they want to add them let them. Does not mean you need to buy into the keys. Microtransactions is just a way for a game to keep the servers up and the developing to continue on. I experience very few problems with lag or fps drops but I also have played many early access games and expect there to be problems until the game is fully released.
Great fun by yourself better with friends.
Simple concept ridiculous high skill ceiling.
One of the best and addicting games I've ever played! Keep it up and keep the game alive!!
SSS
Very good game defonately recommend it!
This game has 10/10.
Amazing game. Few hackers but overall 8/10 )
THERE IS AD POP UP IN MAIN OF MY GAME SCREEN AND I CANT PLAY ANYMORE!SOMEONE KNOWS HOW TO REMOVE THIS ADS?

really good
Matchmaking worksTeamwork is KeyThere is no teamworkSome killers are disproportionately goodDLC for daysPlay with close friends or not at all
This should be fun...So yeah great game. Great concept. Every match is different... except for one little part. YOUR SERVERS.WHY DONT YOU TAKE ALL THE MONEY YOUVE MADE AND INVEST IN SERVERS THAT DONT LAG EVERY 27.357 SECONDS. IT'D MAKE THE GAME MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE.Yeah that's about it. 3/5. Good game.
11/10 Has it's own porn gif creator.
Nice game!
great game but they broke the promise of microtransactions.
good game
Fix the f**king matchmaking so this game could even somehow be playable.
i got rocket league since it released i said that it was cleary a good game just need to clear from kids from the ranekd they just like little interferences.
Game is pretty good. Graphics sre good story is good with lots of possibilities. There is a minus tons of hackers tryhards in online. For me I'll vote 7/10
I just played 6 games and recorded it all!!! EVERY GAME IS FILLED WITH HACKERS!!! FIX THIS ISSUE
i cant buy survivor pass
辣鸡服务器更新后进不去
meh
Even though I've only played it for 6 hours I've had more adrenaline rushes in those 1v1's for first place than I have had in the hundreds of ours I have in CSGO and thousands of hours in League of Legends. And if you lose those 1v1's you don't get mad because you've made it so far and done better than 98 other players. It's an ecstatic feeling! I would rate this game 4.5/5 because it is still early access and has frame rate issues.
ooh Rockstar Xbox 360 bought GTA V.Xbox One another one.And there comes PC and another one.No regrets All love.
Very nice and addictive game
.
ing got banned for singleplayer mods piece of rockstar.
Basically if you like fair play and actual team work this is not your game it's okay if you like being shot from 5000km away with a shotgun and hackers in every corner the only way this game is fun is when you play with friends and not because it improves in anyway but because you are with your friends and you can kill them and then revive them to kill them again. (BTW if you want to shoot someone far away just aim behind them not in front because everyone knows bullets go thru space time and apear in the front of them)
one of the best games I have ever played
This was a huge disappointment for me. I felt as if there was virtually no content. The interface and the ingame action felt glitched and it created almost no sense of immersion for me. I'm a huge fan of indie games though so I still wish the developers good luck.
Nice game. Needs alot fixes. Especially when people crouch jump it's registered as hacking lmao. 5/5
My account was bannde for no reason!
"Just a few cars with nitro tunning playin' ""soccar"" how revolutionary!"
Ower Hyped t I don't understad why all the positive reviews on youtube.They just make you fight with T rex in a very small space i'ts not fun just anoyng. The grind in this game is sheet fight a monster for 30 min only to get fainted by the bullsheet one it K.O the fight him again. DONT BUY save your money
"The premise of PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is similar to the hunger games. You parachute in from a plane before scavenging for supplies while constantly being pushed to a smaller and smaller zone by an incomming ""storm"". Game focuses on making things like map and weapons realistic unlike some other very *similar* game. While the graphics of this game are amazing I believe that many of the players don't get to experience it because of the crappy performance this game provides. While it will still run on medium specs pcs it a no for lower specs pcs beacuse this game bottlenecks literally everything. It's a multiplayer game with no story that gives you the freedom to approach your problem how you want or to solve an incomming problem that is comming straight at you. Only until recently there havent been any dlcs or a ranking system to this game. With that situation in the past it's weird how people stayed loyal and kept coming back to this game. Now there is a season pass available for purchase which gives you a ranking system and a way to unlock cosmetics. Free users get a change to unlock *SOME* of these rewards on *CERTAIN* levels of the pass with a great slowdown in progress of levels. Gameplay wise you get an option to choose between first person mode or perhaps a third person mode in which first person mode is still available. Gameplay includes standard long range fights or perhaps if you prefer something mid range or close range that is available as well. Game utilises the usage of vehicles to get around its huge and detailed map. All in all if you can ignore the problems of this game like some bugs and a medium amount of cheaters the game at the current price is worth also it's worth mentioning that the event pass is not expensive and it is easily affordable."
This game is Incredibly fun to play with friends. Its a game that is very difficult to survive. (Quite Difficult if Beginner). Yet its very easy to learn and pick up.Even if this game kinda repeats itself (If playing Surival) it just keeps getting fun by the minute.I havent really experienced all the gamemodes but i have played Survival ALOT and my max days is 28 getting there was so satisfying. And surviving Winter is truly difficult without a doubt.I can't really think about anything bad about the game. Some stuff i hate which isent really a bug or anything like that is you can get quite punished if you cut down trees as there might spawn a big Tree Guard which (Probably can't get killed).The only time I actually killed that Tree Guard was spending a whole day burning down Trees and kited the (Demi Boss) onto them so he started to go on fire but still even after i killed the boss it was quite impossible to survive the rest of the day.But the idea of the game is genius. The way the game looks is one of my favorite parts of this game.Even though i only played this game for a couple of hours and havent gotten to end game.I could undoubtedly say this game is my favorite game.Its easy for me to find a game i love but this game is above only ''loving'' this game.And i always bother my friends to play the game with me because of the sole reason of this game is outrageously amazing!My total rating might aswell be 10/10 but i think me giving it that would be stupid mainly because i havent even reached endgame or not even finishing a game but to be full out there only because i havent experienced the end game would make it a 8.5/10 but i think this game has a potential of 10/10 once ive experienced more of this truly fantastic game!Update I have been playing a bit of The Forge which is an event and ive not played a lot of it but I did spend around 3 hours on it non stop and all i can say is that its truly fantastic! Very fun as i said even though this game repeats itself its still fun. And that the game does kinda repeat itself on survival and in The Forge i personally think that that is the reason i love it but thats me personally.
Son like an activated this classic game on his account so now ive bought all the DLC But cant use it unless he says yes you can?!?!?
Gud game mate
Don't keep throwing money at this game.
Buy it.
After over 1500 hours I still have moments that are pure amazing. The skill ceiling is still getting broken so you always have room to improve. It's well worth the price and time to put in.
Great Game!
Pepsi Gee how can I up my reputation even worse?United Oshit ogeez o Take Two Sexually penetrate me with a cargo plane stunt daddy
Great game only one problem. Everyone that I get teamed up with can never seem to hit the ball towards the enemy goal 3
Autism central
it is a good game i would give it a 8/10
10/10 would bang again
Great Game!
Blue
after every update the game gon af blue hole you
Best Game Ever!
soundtrack
Recomend only if you have the patience to grind from rock bottom on the official servers or have a powerful pc that runs well to have a chance at winning in pvp on the modded ones. Good game so far. Hope they can fix a lot of the bugs and performace issues but it is still in alpha.
Rust is the one game I keep coming back to Server Wipe after Server Wipe.It's ruthless tough and frustrating at times but this all adds to the real survival the game forces you to attempt. It's a genuine start from nothing to owning a full arsenal of weaponary and attempting to raid other bases.Whether playing solo or with others it's exilariting surprising and occasionally even frightening. Don't be put off from having bad starts when you first play there's a huge learning curve of priorities but huge fun to be had. Would whole hearteldy reccomend to all.
What an unoptimized piece of garbage.This is barely a functioning game and I don't think it being in early access justifies that.On top of that the devs have chosen to introduce micro transactions rather than optimizing movement and gunplay which in its current state is utterly f*cked.
very nice game but getting money early on is a and shark cards are a pretty much scam but fun game if u have atleast 4 friends who play it 8/10 )
Love this game One minute you're exploring a new land Then you're running for your life from a fire breathing Tyrannosaurus.
GG
Has made a comeback
Makes you ) or '(
fuxk this game no use any mod or hack also baneed my account lol nice job rockstar proud of your system
Worth playing .
Eh it's pretty good...
Well to start with i guess i was like alot of other people skeptical of soccer and rockets...After a few games i was hooked never playing normal socer again! If your on the fence because you dont usaly play sport games give this one a go never laughed so much at my teammates being blown to peices. ahahahaha
The overall game is really good but the gameplay itself is the main focus point.This game's gameplay carries the whole game by itself.
I think the goal is to make your customers like you
last update completely on the game unplayable at the moment with servers giving setback like all the time and bad fps. 1080 gtx and i7 on this computer
It's a good game. But I have to admit that the community is one of the most toxic communities ever! &lt /3
Only reason I brought this game for pc was for mods. Take Two Interactive.
It s GTA
VERI GUD GAME OK
Please add 4 3 800x600 resolution! I have a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 that can run Dota 2 Insurgency CS GO and several other games but not this one due to the lowest res being in 16 9. Maybe one day I will be able to play!
Most boring game ever...not recommended for more than 30 mins/playno point of playing...cars like idiots driving around hitting a ball with jumps and turbo boosts...WOW so much innovation in a game...i cant handle it..
Product received for free. Good game but devs need to listen more to players and work more on game than on skins
Its a great game but I just wanted to ask. How do you get the game to run better on a HP Laptop 8GB Ram 1T?
i just love playing this game . the feels different in each matchbut the the problem i face the most is buildibg rendering issue . itll take min 1 min to render the building .. no other game has this issue .. am not going to buy an ssd for a game
One of the best games i have played in a long time get this game with a few friends and you will have so much fun.The game does have server lag and poor optimization but the gameplay is on point i can not emphasis how good the gameplay is in this gameThey are working on the server lag and the lag i get is only because of havaing 8GB of ram having 16GB you should be good.I highly suggest buying this game
这个游戏 最大的败笔在于GI 非常难以理解拥有极其强大的GI系统的UE引擎 为什么间接光效果可以这么差 后处理效果也都是UE自带的老的那一套 性能低效果差 在光照上如果开发者尽可能使用距离控制的阴影贴图 将远处的阴影使用光照贴图进行模拟 烘焙 在近处使用清晰的实时阴影 即使需要使用更多内存 内存总比1080TI便宜吧 也能大大降低渲染成本 不至于上个山那么卡 同时室内可不可以不要用秘制光照啊 技美大佬走点心吧 窗口用点平面光什么的不好么 您就麻烦一点让我们别那么辣眼睛成不 再贵20块钱也可以接受啊 一句话概括这款游戏 新鲜的主题配上外包般的开发
I heard i would get a nice badge games ok though
the best game but needs better protection against hackers and modders
Not a fun game to play at all.
I BLOODY love this game. Sure it has its ups and downs but over all its fair and fun!(Sorry for the pun by the way)
Product received for free. this game is very adictive so play with care the one and only game makes me place my headset on my head for a long period of time lol
Minecraft with hatred for your fellow man driving you towards an innevitable and tumultuous eend butchered and recycled. PvP exstensive and hyper toxic community
Hell yes!
do you like getting killed all the time? do you want you re loot stolen constantly? then this is the game for you. where you work for hours and don t get anything done. unless you are playing with a friend and doing this to other people. then it is a fun salt mine )
I've only played MH4U on 3DS and while it was fun I did struggle quite a bit. But MHW is a lot easier allowing for new people to learn the game and have fun. I do thoroughly enjoy this game and I personally have no qualms with it. I do strongly recommend it if you've been looking to get in to MH this is the best way to wet your feet. I don't have the best hardware i5 4590 and a 2nd hand Fury X I can with a mix of med and high setting run 1440p at 60FPS and the load times are SO much faster than they are on console it's a joke. I have not had the issues plaguing others my internet disconnects are due to my powerline adapter but even then I rarely DC and it's never happened during multiplayer only solo. I hate paying $80 CAD for games as there is always other BS DLC to add on but with MHW I don't mind the price. In today's age where you need a season pass or other crap to get a full game MHW is a full fledged game with Capcom constantly pushing updates and events without asking for an extra penny. I strongly recommend MHW.
meh
Great Game!
LVL 250 banned for a month + char reset because a cheater dropped money on my head.Rockstar get your sh*t together!Edit Rockstar unbanned me again after 4 days no level reset.
its fun and will be better when it come full game )

Clean crisp graphics raving soundtrack and fast paced gameplay with its great easy to learn hard to master mechanics this game covers almost all the bases of the equation to extract pure fun and epic moments for the enjoyment of all. It is seriously one of the best multiplayer games you can play at the moment get on it! I even bought the DLC (which is extremely rare for me) to support them in creating more games like this absolutely awesome work Psyonix keep it up!
"Product received for free. love this game I give this game ""Game of the Year"""
it continues to crash. very upset so far.
This game is great if you are a beginer at survival games. Its easy and not so hard to get into. The only thing i want in this game is that people like me can host a private server were you can play with your friends without being afraid of other players with better gear.
banned me for no reason. I did not cheat. u game developers. I am no the only one like this. unban me or give my money back
STUPIDDDDDDDDD GAME EVER
ok im already addicted when play this game for the first time . . . goodbye lyfe
Well done. Not being able to move for 10 secs in the beginning of the game when game has finish loaded. When finally able to move killer gets to me within 5 secs.I concluded the 10 secs was NOT waiting for the rest to load. And this wasn't my 1st game where i learn the controls. And the matchmaking is pointless. Cheater in the team? So? why do the whole team needs to be sent back to the lobby? And I'm playing solo. Wont kicking the cheater do it? Why do the rest of us legit players need to be sent back too?
Good game but bad service I always get killed in game in the last minute other players always pre fire and knowing where I hide. That is cheating.Good game but bad experience. I'll play if cheating is prohibited. NOT recommend.
Game of the year !
Great game. Crafting system is intuitive. Progression is excellent. Only thing I wish it had was a single player option. Public servers are a pain because of the people. Worst part about this game is the community. If you build a base in a public server you better expect it to be looted and/or destroyed when you come back to the game.If you like pvp (and many do) then there are tons of massively popular pvp servers. But if you want to survive you better have a group of friends also playing. Or at the very least join a group already established on the server. Trying to go alone is guaranteed suicide.
Time to quit DOTA2great game now my life has a purpose again.will buy all DLC to support this game
I in all honesty love the game rust. And as long as you do you you know that with the things going on recently. They will be fixed and they will make it so that it is possible for people to play the game how the want. You just need to give them time. They could be like the creaters of H1Z1 and not ever do a damn thing. But they listen to their community and the DEVs they love you guys and the game wouldnt be as badass as it is now if we didnt love and play the game. Give them some info. And if its that importent they will fix it they just need the time to think of new things fix some problems and be people all that the same time. DEVS YOU DO YOU. &lt 3
This game doesn't even need a review if you haven't played it you should already know that you need to play it. And if you have played it what are you doing here??
Take Two's anti modding and anti community decisions have really really tarnished this game.I cannot support them any longer because of the decisions they are making which are really taking away from some of the great things about this game solely so they can make another buck (and let's be real they've made PLENTY of money on this already).
This game is awesome would recommend!
Good game
Best GTA ever after Vice City.
Much cheaper way of learning Chinese than Rosetta Stone. 10/10
Good but would be better if you could jump straight into a new game straight from the end screen. Did find it quite buggy but might just be my setup. Got a lot of texture pop and jerkiness also kept defaulting to Australian servers. Might jump back in post launch when the experience is a little more polished.
I SERIOUSLY DON'T LIKE THIS GAME SINCE THE BIG UPDATE AND THE NEW MAP ( YOU RUINED IT... YOU HAVE TO MAKE US ABLE TO CHOOSE WHICH MAP WE WANT TO PLAY!
THIS GAME ITZ GOOD BUT WHEN I PLAY 1 MINUTE IT SHOWSME A ERROR AND THEY KICKED ME OUT
microtransactions but sp good
The game is really great however to see the best side of it you need a beefy computer. But once you get said beefy computer this game is impressive on so many levels. Even without the beefy computer it's fun to play just not as visually pleasing
Better then fortshit
So much fun!
FIX THE GAME!!!!!!!!!!
Microtransactions nothing done to combat griefing axing mod support and anti consumerist practices make this a product hard to endorse.
You can ride on walls and look at balls gr8 b8 m8 8/8
Truly a game for marathon enthusiasts at last ported to PC. 9.8/10 IGN and Deviljho of the year. Seriously. Devijho the gretest of pickles has now been added to the PC release which automatically makes this game a sublime experience the very few games could ever possibly achieve.
Have my upvote
This game is great but it'll be better if the resolution and game spec can go lower a bit. cuz it sometimes goes smooth but sometimes it goes very laggy on my pc but anyway still a great game
good
Do you like cars?soccer? Hockey? Basketball? Being competitive? Then play this game. Thats it. Go play this game. GO. GO NOW.
F*ck you Take 2
Still has quite a lot of bugs to be fixed but had a really good improvement in the past months. Good job! I'm also really happy they implemented a new system so you can check the host's ping.
"This game found the perfect sweetspot of H1Z1 and Arma 3 BR.The arcady gameplay of H1Z1 combined this the hardcore feeling of Arma 3.Sure there are Bugs and the performance should be better but both problems are worked on.This game has the potential to be the best ""Battleroyale"" on the market.Developers show though blogs twittter and Facebook on which problems they are working on and what concent will be in upcoming patches."
I CAN FINALLY AERIAL!
i played a little bit. it's okay.
the new version of rust is bad the original version was 10 times better than the version it is now
Product received for free. This game is fun to play and i had no issue with the frame as it is very playable with my crappy laptop.
PROS for the goodness of your connection. Fun and great community. CONS HUGE A S S PATCHES
tl dr Single player is fully worth the price tag.I had a blast with the single player. Great storyline with interesting/funny missions.I'm not really fond of the multiplayer though.I don't really feel attracted to the missions.There are currently a lot of people who use publicly available hacks/scripts/.... which completely ruin your experience.They kill you give you all weapons/ammo money ...Doing random stuff with friends could lead to funny moments though.
GTA V lives up to the classic franchise
Awesome game if your PC can run it that is. Tons of action. It reminds me a lot of DayZ with the boring running sim taken out.
Product received for free. Free pls
#Regionlockchina Nobody wants to play with you robots.
Product received for free. Too expensive.
Very good game... Just its hard to play solo but its funny
Online mode is the biggest waste of time ever you just get into a game and you get hacked right away and then rockstar bans your account. Payed $60 for a game that I cannot even play the way its intended to be played thanks to the other players. While I was playing someone transferred a bunch of money into my account and then teleported me to 4000ft in the air after which I fell to my death and stopped playing. I later tried to log in and discovered that my entire account had been suspended for something that was out of my control. The actual modder is probably still passing out money against other players' will. I don't appreciate this and I ultimately regret buying the game in the first place.
Product received for free. Like to ....... prostitute.
Hilarious game play! Especially if you're like me.
good game
Not a single clue what you guys did with this recent update. The game officially has aids....
this game is just bad
I havent been able to play at all since they took the game out of early access with there crappy EAC. I cant play the game at all becuase its constant EAC disconnect. Ive uninstalled ive verified game cache ive looked up tons of ways to try to fix it. Ive spent more time finding ways that actually playing. Itd be better if they removed EAC and just let Steam s VAC system take over.
plain and simple t. Bullets always miss even when you have no ping or fps problems you always seem to lose the gun fights or fire a shotgun round into someones face/chest when they have no armor and they just shrug it off like your firing at their faces. total t.I still play it besides all the that happens e_e
fu king trash
h
I had a lot of fun playing this with my friends. Much better than h1z1
The online session is totally trash I didn't play GTA online for a long time and finally bought this game during the winter sales but when I connect to online session the game told me my online account has been banned permanently. I'm like what the is this ???!!! I spent 4hrs to download this game with full excitement to see what's new in the GTA online and BOOM! Full of dissapointments. All of my hardwork in GTA online BOOM gone just like that and there's no point for me to grind again for another 300++ hrs to achieve back what I achieved before. Save your money on other games don't buy this piece of (P.S I bought physical copy before this)
Loud noise Jump Land Walk for 20min Die to a random kar98Yep that sums it up...
I have waited since this game came out on Xbox to play it. I watched videos to slate my thirst I read some reviews on it. But when it came out for PC I didn't want to drop $60 on it. Then I remembered how long I had waited for it and said screw it. It's been almost 2 fricken years but I finally got it and it has absolutely blown me away. None of the problems that GTA IV's PC port had. Only sweet lovely BEAUTIFUL perfection. If I didn't have to do work around my house I'd be on this all day.Get it.
ITS AMMMMMMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG &lt 3&lt 3&lt 3&lt 3&lt 3 Play it! BUY IT LOVE IT
Great game but..Duenevo (I think that's how it's spelled) chops fps in half and hurts paying customers.If you alt+tab it crashes.Multiplayer servers crash 1/3rd of the time.When servers are working you must all complete parts of the mission solo since everyone hasn't seen a pointless cutscene?Mouse acceleration and no FOV slider Hope they get to fixing these issues cause the base gameplay is spot on.
Too many cheaters that are not detected
It is absolutely disgusting what this game has turned into especially the multiplayer. And now with the cease and desist of a major mod used by many I can whole heartenly tell everyone that this game is not and probably never will be worth it. The same will likely be said for any future game that Take Two the owner company of Rockstar publishes.

Is a good game. But T2 for ing over OpenIV.
this game made my dad blind hehe xD jk hes fine
You are like John Cena.. alone but strong enough to beat everyone.
This game is always one I can fall back on when all other games fail. I love the quick game plays and new content that comes out.
Hell of more fun than H1 you can clearly see it got some functions from Arma 3 and from H1 aswell. I recommend you to pick it up instanly if you like a heartpumping game.
It's a very good game and it have much chances to be the best game of the world in 2017.
I'm here for the protest
Amazing horror game woke up neighbors cause I was being chased by a Hillbilly with a chainsaw. 10/10 have fun spooking your friends
"This is one of the coolest games I've played on the PC. Three words ""Minecraft on steroids."" I like everything about this game and even though its 20 bucks. It's worth it. The only problem you might run into is players who act like raiders and bandits. But I recommend making allies. Stay frosty!"
Do you like any of the previous GTA games in the series?Do you like cars planes boats guns and explosions?Have you ever wanted to punch a chimpanzee?How long has it been since you passed out drunk and woke up in a dumpster?Maybe its time to get it if you haven't already. It's just money after all..
PUBG... It s awesome.. It sucks.. It makes me happy... It makes me sad... PUBG gives me everything a good game needs.It s intense.. and this is why I love it!
Was killed by a car that didnt make any noise. Game requires map variety. Most players go to the same spot (school military base prison etc.). Players who drop on less contested areas tend to camp out till the end.Network LagCrouch jumping is essential but is extremely difficult to do especially for new players.Hit registration sometimes comes quite late sometimes. So if you are hit a few times without getting any health deductions you can make it to cover only to see you health bar go down suddenly and die.
My first monster hunter experience at first I hated this game. The port turned my 1080ti into a nuclear reactor the camera was awful and i couldn't find a weapon I was good at.Giving it a fair shot I disabled some seemingly useless graphics options and my temperatures returned to normal I looked up a guide on how to git gud with my edgy katana.Now I think the game is brilliant except nergie screw that dragon.11/10 would melt my pc again.
very fun game get very salty when i die
Great game amazing action and just the right amount of fun. even better when you play with mates
The servers are down...
Only recommend it for the SinglePlayer and I still demand a DLC.Other than that just give up on Online Rockstar.Cheaters heaven way too expensive stuff that you get bored of 20 minutes later. VERY expensive shark cards 8 million for 75 euros are you mental? And the worst part is that you cant even buy them in Single Player AT LEAST only with Trainers.
i am angery but i am happy it's freezing middle game with friends and it's so annoying because i need to shut my comuter and open and call my friends and get back to the game why is this happening can someone tell me please?and it's a good game there is a lot of bugs but it's fun and i enjoying playing it.
I just buy the game and played only 25minutes. Game Banned Me WTF ? I want my money back ASAP.
Thank Jesus H Christ I cashed out on my H1 skins.
its ok
If you want to play a great game then this is it if you want a terrible community this is it. If you want to get banned for no reason this is it! 1st ban did some cheat engine manipulations got banned for 30 days ok deserved.2nd ban banned for no reason 30 days ok since i cheated once maybe banning someone twice is how rockstar does it D3rd ban after around 6 months i deceide to play play a while and permament ban (no cheats exploits nothing) 300hrs down the drain no explanations terrible support community a bunch of idiotic kids just calling you a cheater. So yeah if you want to waste your time and money play gta online.
fine

This game is hype but don't confront the 12 year olds calling you gay because they will report you and you will get banned by the garbage bot system. This game is HYPE but the community is actual cancer.
"so this is a triple A?no optimized pc controls seems to be pretty much the cheap standard today.its pretty much unplayable with mouse + keyboardswitching through items while using a bow for example is unbearable.and u just might say here well there are lots of other perfectly fine weapons to use!that might be the case but its a matter of principle in this case.if that wasnt enough there is a useless ""intro phase"" at the beginning that just seems to be there for the sole purpose of locking u out of the main game for aprox. 2 h so that u cant refund it anymore.its not as grindy as i feared but 15 mins time limit on missions is a trigger factor... whats the purpose?coupled with the fact that the glowflies dont always work perfectly you can imagine the frustration when you finally confronted a beast in its lair and almost killed it just to get the ""time's up"" message.... close but no cigar for u sir!you might have fun with friends if they had any incentive to play with you in lower tiers.all in all its not very beginner friendly and in a negative way. i just dont have the time anymore to watch a dozen youtube clips to become better. if you are invested and have the time this might be actually perfect for you. just wasnt for meand goddamn whats wrong with good pc controls? its not that hard. others can do it. and their game isnt 60 bucks + multiplatform(equals more revenue)just look at dauntless. not as much content as MHW im sure but the controls are very good.and its free2play. so i guess it CAN be donenowadays all this is just a red flag for me..."
Really great game always updating and improving no pointless updates like many other games and it doesnt get boring. The new map is a bit but it grows on you you learn it like we all did over time on Erangel. The game is beautiful and looks good on medium settings. I play on high settings with a minimum 50fps with an okay pc 1050 GTX i5 x4 processor 16gb RAM. I would highly recommend it to everyone.
Is a good game ...

"First you have a cheating problem which is just part of the Chinese problem. I don't mind playing with Chinese players but they cheat and they treat the game badly. They are loud and obnoxious in the waiting area and on the plane so much so that I have to totally disable voice communication. The cheating is obvious why not pay money and use a better anti cheating system I rarely see cheaters in BFBC2 and I played that for a while but we had to use Punk Buster. I understand that Chinese players are what gives you numbers but you aren't going to increase numbers this way you have already saturdated the Chinese market and other markets aren't going to jump onboard if all they hear is yelling followed by being shot in the head from the other side of the map in 2/3 games. I have had good games with some Chinese guys and I don't mind the loud obnoxious open voice thing but i can't stand the cheating. Somtimes I feel like grabbing a microphone and yelling ""China #2 Taiwan #1"" but I don't mainly because i think half of them would turn their cheats on. Also your shooting mechanics seem to be broken half the time."
this game is so dumb why do i love it so much
THIS GAME IS AMAZING STOP BEING A BABY AND GIVING IT A NEGATIVE BECAUSE YOU SUCK AT THE GAME!!! ROFLMAO
A Rimworld Tale... Our escape pods crash landed on a tropical Rimworld. Just Doc Miss Farmer and Chef on a strange world.We gathered what resources we could from the wreckage and slept the night rough on the floor of a cave.The next day we started building a lavish stronghold before planting a few crops.Before we knew it the rations we scavenged were gone (should have planted crops first). So we were forced to hunt the local wildlife for food.A cry for help came over the radio. It was Doc's sister Princess she'd also survived planet fall and was being chased by raiders!We set out in force and rescue her and bring her back to the fortress. We celebrate with a hearty meal of our first crop.It turns out that Chef is a nudist. In a bid to make her more comfortable we let her spend her days o'natural. Everyone is fine with it.Our home of Fort Haven is finally finished and we start researching upgrades. Chef makes a statue of her self striding around in the nude and we use it to decorate the guest room.Another escape pod crashes down. We rescue the occupant some guy called Aiki. He's a junkie with violent tendencies.We patch up his wounds give him a hot meal and send him on his way.Both Doc and Princess catch plague! I bet it was that space junkie. They're instantly confined to bed.It take some doing but Doc treats Princess and Princess treats him.Raiders attack with half our crew bedridden with disease. We push them back but Chef is badly injured.Miss Farmer carries her back to Fort Haven and heals her wounds.Through sibling compassion and their medical know how Doc and Princess survive the plague and Chef is also restored to full health.Realising how vulnerable we are we start building defensive gun turrets. We need more metal so everyone heads off to mine.Princess doesn't like mining and for some reason she snaps. She runs around setting fires all over the place.Doc and Farmer knock her out and put her to bed but not before the fires spread taking out a huge section of forest to the North.A huge army of raiders attack. Perhaps they saw the fires? The attack our walls and devastating most of our crops. The new gun turrets come online and we mow them down.With our crops in a bad way and our food supplies low Chef recommends eating the would be raiders...A fun game. Would crash onto a Rimworld and eat man flesh again...
the amount of times in have die to that stupid red zone its unrealy and stupid coz when u put the effort into killing people and getting gear is bed enough and out the blue your dead to red zone your gonna lose so many players its just streamers that play it for money anyway
gr8 game lmao
With the new release I can safely say this game is F U N. The First person aspect of the game feels loads better and there's significantly less rubberbanding and desyncs. The game looks great at lower graphical settings without being as taxing as it initially was during early access. The game used to take 90% of my processing power but now it runs at a nice 20% and 40% GPU. Good stuff!
This game is so amazing! only brought it recently and can't stop playing it! Its a must buy D
This is one of those games that has an UI that is just not logical nor designed for PC I also cannot pause the game to google how to properly aim my weapon and died while attempting to do so. Doesn't seem like a game I can enjoy.I have chosen to refund it unfortunately.
"Rust is in a state of total I as a player hope and trust in the Devs to make this game better however.You will see all these reviews saying this the devs suck they make things worse. To be fully honest with you the past 3 months with the components system has sucked complete I know by year 4 this game SHOULD be polished and fun but it isnt. If you are willing to put your trust into the Devs then play this game expect the game to change from when you buy it. Having said this this is what you should buy rust for.Clans. If you have a large group of people 5 20 then this is the game for you. You will dominate all the servers with tyranny and complete control. The people of the server will hate you however and have no respect what so ever.Roleplay. This is what you should play if your solo or if you have a small group of 2 4. Build a shop build a hospital do whatever you want! But be wary people will raid kill and hunt you down without remorse just for being a roleplayer. This is the most fun way to play the game at the moment. Build a town. This is what Rust was meant to be like build a town make neighbors surround it with a wall. This is the dream of most solo players out there this is the most fun way to play the game. People how ever are s so choose your community wisely or you will be backstabbed by some 12 year old.The three types of players in Rust.KOS basically s some people arent s but most are. This is the easiest way to play rust but the worst in terms of fun.Eye for an eye. You dont shoot me i dont shoot you. The fair and most fun way to play the game this is how it was meant to be played. ( expect to be killed because of aimcone )What most people call roleplayers but i call ""too friendly"". They will not kill you even if you are killing them. They are the Liberals of rust believing in a world that will never happen and in turn get too salty every time they get killed. The of rust in terms of fun you will feel like a Mormon looking for followers.What to take away from this review To have the most fun build a pretty looking base ( expect to be raided even if you build a big base you will still be raided so just have fun with it. ) dont kill someone unless they shoot first ( expect to be double headshot and killed because of aimcone ) make a lot of friends and make a town of nakeds you found on the beach roleplay and make a community hospital or a casino or a strip club etc. Remember if you play this game religiously or in any means tryhard you will hate it. Just have fun."
10/10 except for dieing to cars every damn game
This game is still great without a controller 10/10 Better than FIFA
game sucks I cant run it on the lowest settings. dont even have a bad computer. go yourself blue hole.
Product received for free. omg its the best game ever D
It's a great game but it's hard af lol
Great take on post apocalyptic survival games. Lots of fun to team up with people and establish bases build up your weaponry and research technologies that help you against other players attacks. You have to grind through the first few hours to get yourself going but then things start to move smoothly. Definitely worth trying to find some people to team up with as you will progress much more quickly. Love this game!
Sure you can get farther by picking and loading your mods but I picked this up again just to see what they had done and now I am neck deep in another replay. Sword and board in this on survival is a thrill. Sneaky bow man gets broken around level 20.
To all you people out there with 2ghz computers and such. the game is great on the alpha (rust legecy) but on rust 2.0 or what ever it is terrable for my 2.4ghz so just play the alpha when you get it. in time the dev. will make it so we can play rust with out huge lag spikes every seconds. So please Facepunch think of the childern with low end pc's Me im the children!
Much better than CS GO!
Its not a good game over all Im giving it a negative review cuz of all the bugs that there are still in game like when u get stuck when ur car randomly exploding and the massive fps drop when a stun granade getting threw tons of lags etc.
game is good
Pretty Fun.
pretty lit. but i have a crappy computer so its lag af. 7/10 10 if i had a real pc
GOOD GAME
Good
The best BR game that ive played so far.
Psyonix devin is a fat neckbeard and this games banning system is broken
Rust is one of the only positive reviewed survival games that I've played and it damn well deserves it.
Got really boring really fast.
This game suffers from the classic Early Access fever. Unoptimized full of bugs runs like crap on high end setups. Stay away.
Holy you guys ed up.....never supporting you guys ever again.0 out of 10
I have made a terrible mistake buying this game.I bought it mainly for the online but it is just a mess. Getting money is more of a chore than a fun mechanic. What a waste of space.Meatballs.
rip mods

"Keyboard warriors and fan boys turn away now. Cheers.This is the most broken F****** Game I have ever played in my life!!!! I can't even play it anymore! WHY SERIOUSLY WHY THE F*** DOES VALVE LET DEVELOPERS LIKE THESE PIECES OF LITERAL SELL THEIR USELESS BROKEN UNPLAYABLE GAMES ON STEAM PLEASE TELL ME WHY!?! THE LOADING SCREEN IS BROKEN THE MAIN MENU IS BROKEN THE MATCHMAKING IS BROKEN HALF THE BUTTONS DONT EVEN LET YOU CLICK THEM!! THE NETWORKING IS BROKEN BEYOND ANYTHING THE FPS IS BROKEN ASF! I know it's in early access but that is no excuse to sell people such a disgustingly broken piece of money grabbing game IF you can call it a game.And do not say that I don't know what I'm talking about because I have 0.6hrs. I have 100hrs+ on a different account playing it now and then when they say the have ""fixed bugs"" which we all know is not true.Although this 'game' is terrible is still MAYBE just f****** might have a slight bit of potential left. IF the developers get their together.PROS If you like to stress the f*** out and rage until you pull your hair out pick this game up it'll be perfect for you!CONS BROKEN BROKEN BROKEN BROKEN BROKEN. Fix your f****** game.Not worth $30 what so ever.Bye have a great time."
Use to love this game its just broken and isnt the same anymore. Loved the game before they got greedy and started adding all these crates with keys. I mean thats annoying but theres so many other issues with this game. Just not the same.
ing nice game.
I have no clue why this game gets such high ratings. The battle mechanics are total garbage for pc. You spend 99% of the time missing everything or rolling around until you end up inside one of the monsters. Then you die.Rinse repeat. Everything is so confusing and not intuitive. Just following a quest ends up being a confusing ordeal. I bought it on sale. And I regret that I even did that. This game sucks.
TLDR Good game expect bugs and glitches but an overall experience that is calming and relaxing that I keep coming back to due to the active devs. If its on sale its a must buy.If you like to watch a video version of this video you can find it here.OverviewAstroneer is a $20 game which fortunately a friend bought me. The price of this game is not justified compared to other games you can play for $20 in terms of receiving a polished product. That being said I would look at this game not as a ready to play product but rather an experience. As of this review I have logged in close to 14 hours but I don't plan on adding to that number anytime soon. The developers tend to prefer small changes as opposed to larger patches. Returning to this game to find many changes made is refreshing which is why I tend to return to this game periodically to note all the developments made. I was hesitant to review this game because of its unfinished state but I really wanted to explain how this game is different from others in the early access program and why it is worth at least a look into.OK THIS GAME IS PRETTY WONKY. Do not expect everything to work 100% of the time. Astroneer has this certain charm. The anger you feel for this game could be directed at a small puppy or an angry ex. At times when it messes up you can't help but laugh and start over but at times after you've put in all this effort into mining and gathering materials only to fall into a pit and die. GameplayWhen the gameplay does work its is really a unique experience the building/excavator tool in this game provides a whole new depth to the world as you aren't forced to react to events statically you can build a shelter or dig a whole. You mold the world into your needs which adds a dimension of satisfaction. Can't reach a mineral because it's across a trench? Build a bridge across. Gathering materials is this risky adventure. It seems mundae but in this game it becomes a risk vs reward situation. Should you go grab that extra copper you see or turn back now with all materials you have collected? The only major problem with the game is the end game there is none. Once you have amassed enough materials you are free to take your spaceship to another planet only to start the process all over again. I would like to see this concept expanded upon What if the planets you visit next belong to another player who has made their planet open to exploration? What if there was enough players on a planet that resources become extremely valuable and tradable. I know these are concepts that are really out there especially for an indie dev company but it would be really amazing to see this game progress that far. It will also be interesting to see how they keep the game simple and still attempt to keep the players attention.FeaturesThere is a really cool oxygen and energy system that forces players to get creative. Your space ship can have tethers attached to it which provide a line of oxygen to the player. The more tethers you chain together the further you can explore while still having an oxygen supply. Power is also derived from your spaceship which can be produced by generators solar panels and windmills. Power is supplied so long as you are hooked onto a tether. What this means is your rate of exploration is severely limited by how creatively you use your resources. It sort of works in a loop the more you explore the better gear you can make which leads to more and faster exploration. Atmosphere and PacingThe pace of this game is very relaxing. Currently there are no mobs in the game and the only things that have killed me so far have been sandstorms toxic gases pitfalls and major bugs. And usually major bugs lead to pitfalls so I guess there's not too many options there. Astroneer provides this relaxing gameplay but still manages an initially addicting sense of progression. This game is fun to play with friends or by yourself it is not really dependent on external factors for entertainment like some many other games are. However you will eventually find the pace of the game to become boring and strungout. The tasks you complete are extremely repetitive and while there is the aforementioned resource management it's not complicated and comparatively lands below games like Minecraft or Terraria. Anyone looking for a similar experience to those games will be sorely disappointed. Astroneer is a game designed to be a non competitive experience. A pure game which is why there are no mobs in the world. While it would make the game more interesting mobs within the game would just create panic. And I get the sense that System Era aren t really going for that vibe.GraphicsSo it goes without saying a game doesn t need realistic graphics to be beautiful and Astroneer does a great job of portraying this. Many indie developers are in a budget constraint for assets and it really provides them with an opportunity to be creative and make do with what they have. This game consistently looks pretty. Whether it be tunneling deep down in a cave or running tethers across a bare plain this game has got me in awe. The color choice in this game is really amazing and vibrant at times and dull and melancholic during others. The vibrant tones can clash hard with the somber musical melodies that are accomied in the game. While such a sharp contrast would not suit most situations in Astroneer it adds this mysterious almost eerie feeling. In a huge world it makes the player feel... small.Should you buy this game?Astroneer is a game that needs polish. However its core mechanics and design are very attractive so attractive that I believe that it suits the $20 price tag. While there isn t much depth to the game story wise there is a certain atmosphere that this game builds that I really don t find in other games. It treats itself so casually but once the player starts to explore the word and becomes immersed you start to realize just how lonely it is especially you are playing the single player. Maybe that's the point of the game maybe that's the only goal of the game. To make you realize that no matter how much you do there is still more to discover. That is till you reach the end game. Would I purchase Astroneer if I was you? Yes but maybe wait till there is sale.Pros+ Active Devs+ Simple Yet Beautiful Graphics+ Complimenting Soundtrack+ Initially Addicting Gameplay+ Fun with friends or Solo+ Much to Explore (But can feel hollow at times)+ Moldable Environment+ Lot of mechanics available for the player to explore+ Casual and Relaxing gameCons Lacking a good End Game Can become grindy past the mid game Can feel slow paced compared to other games Bugs and Glitches are apparent Little variety in Environmental Hazards

Are you tired of fifa but you like that type of game. Then fear not rocket league is for you.
Great game to play with friends and test your skills. Although this game sucks because there is no Anti Cheat system which results in most games and deaths by cheaters...
i love this game
Very Good Game Takes some time to complete a match sometmes a full hour it depends how good you are. I hope there will be a better store sytem in the Future.
Product received for free. Nice game wiht friends on online but litlebit boring alone...
This is by Far the Best Video Game I've purchased!It's so good that I can't stop loving it! The only Cons I want to mention is that Lack of Team work if do don't have Pro Friends to Play with! Everything is just fantastic! I spent 23 USD on this game on sale with 3.5 Million Cash in game cards which was tottally worth buying! Fantastic Game/ ignore the Trolls! they're everywhere! Add me if you want!
lit game
Very excited survival game that you mostly ended up with natural laughing gas.
Only played Heists with friends but it was great
Creo que va a ser un excelente juego talvez le falta un poco organizacion o mas modos de juego pero en general es un gran juego
Vroom Vroom + Balls Best Gaem 10/10
Thank god my 3 year old PC can run this beast. 10/10
wtf i got banned for month and now it mak me buy gam agen??!?!?!? dat big gae
i think its a very good game worth my money worth anyones money aure u have to deal with hackers but seriously every game has hackers.
OINDICKO Flashlight00 beek_jong_won1 这三名玩家合伙组队 对我言语攻击 因为我说不了话 把我击杀 必须把他们封了 不然我感觉我会把视屏剪辑到各个娱乐网站 一直炒作 我不信只有我一个遇到这类的问题 太气人了.
Take Two is a scummy business. I hate it when corporate greed shuts down something good. Meanwhile millions are cheating ONLINE in your games (which you do NOTHING about) and you can't handle people modding a singleplayer portion? Are you kidding me? RIP Rockstar.
Really great game after the 1.0 update. Servers are much better the maps are well designed guns are balanced the graphics as good as always and the performance is really improved now. There might be a few hackers here and there but just give the game some time it just left Early Acces so it has time to get better and better. I have high expectations from this game and I wish they are going to become true soon. After all its totally worth it.. EDIT1 game dont buy waste of money... EDIT2 Still pretty good game and enjoyable mostly with friends EDIT3 Broken game not worth it rn EDIT4 Game don't even bother spending a penny on it. EDIT5 New update live implemeting a new map and a SEASON PASS... Even less reasons to play this game anymore.
The games good really fun although the amount of in game money you need to buy the dlc products almost makes free roam pointless.
I am going to give my honest opinion. I never really cared for really any kind of modding in this game (singleplayer or rp servers). I know that take two has messed up if that wasn't obvious from all the other 99% of reviews. I know it's not because of taking Opev VI was asked to stop it's the reason from what I know there wasn't any reason to make Open VI stop. However you should not be getting mad about something that is not even really meant to be in the game in the first place. This does make me want to try an RP server or mod in singleplayer a bit more. I just wish all these reviews were about the base game which they should be. About the base game The start is always the hardest part about most games especially this one. All you have to do is grind and find ways to make money and have fun at the same time. Modders in multiplayer are a problem but you can just find a new session.I find this game to be somewhat addictive when you are always making objectives for yourself about what thing you want next (car tank office building etc).Trolls in multiplayer can sometimes give you a laugh but the ones who just shoot you out of your car for no reason kinda ruin the fun sometimes.This is my honest opinion so far about this game and what has happened in the GTA V Modding community
They just killed half the game community. gg T2
Endless hours of pleasure
Sneaky fun.
Playerunkown's brokengrounds
STAY OFFLINE NOTHING BUT JET TROLLS AND STICKY BOMBS. IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLETE ONINE MISSIONS BECAUSE SOMEONE RUINS IT INTENTIONALLY. TROLLS. PAY TO WIN.
The game is now in the best state is has ever been in 3 different maps ability to choose maps as well as much better optimized than before. Kash
A good game but ing buggy as and with micro transactions in early access on a side note Bluehole dont copy a 17 year old concept then complain when others do it better than you
This game is by far one of the most fun games I've played in a while. When they announced this game WAY back i legit could not wait. Been a fan for a super long time and this is something that i wish would've happened earlier but im glad that some time has past. The game looks amazing and the areas are vast little things hidden here and there. Always something to enjoy and this game is for everyone. Personally when im not hunting monsters I just sit back and the enjoy the environment every living thing in this game breathes life and its just so damn gorgeous. Ive been so many hours on this game but its nohere near close to the previous monster hunter game that I own.
please fix the 'app already running'
Best game ever!
11/10
fun
It has a very interesting concept though the players will delete any reason you could casually want to play. The idea of constructing and building everything from your weapons to your base was very appealing and the idea of a sandbox pvp was neat. Everything uplifting ends there. When starting out the game boils down to farming for materials then getting backstabbed or shot respawn and try again...recycle rinse and repeat a hundred times over until you damn near chuck your pc out the window.
Best early access game I have played so far. Laggy at times but that is what you should expect when a game is in Early Access. Very addicting to play for hours on end.
This game is great. When I am playing this game I am usually playing on a pretty lowspec computer. But even on the lowest settings and mods to make my game run better this game still looks greats. In conclusion you should buy this game if you have the money of course because this game can get a bit pricey. )
Hackers on every server make this the most profitable and enjoyable game you can ever play buy it.
If you like the Harvest Moon series you will love this.It has a lot of the feeling of the original series with a few other additions that make it unique.Amazing game the ratings speak for itself.
So... 600 Hours played. My most played Game on Steam (not my most played game just not on steam).TBH if you are still alive and didnt play this game play it.Thats the Short answer.Long Answer This Game has an Open World that is so amazing that i feel like im in the World of Los Santos.This led me too spending 100 Hours just running around enjoying the Open World and Detail trying to be a fkn Taxi in the Open World etc..The Graphics are amazing. 10/10The Story is good fantasticly told and an amazing Ending.The Story itself tho is at least for me is pretty ok.The only thing to gripe about is that Trevors Story is a bit over the top even by Gta standards.GameplayNoice very noiceMods will make your Singleplayer Experience 20 times better.(DO NOT USE MODS FOR STORY MISSIONS)
This is worst move what you could do. Add micro transaction before you release game.FIX BUGS AND LAGS FIRST THEN ADD MICRO TRANSACTION.
My potato pc cant handle this game mehhh
Completly amazing game i strongly recommend it especially if it is on sale!
Just the game I wanted..one of the most played game on steam...major fixes and optimization on release...I would definitely recommend the game..Jump#parachute#shoot#kill#winnerwinner chickendinner..
Ive played 130 hours in the last 2 weeks jesus help meAlso i have school and work so put 2&amp 2 together and RIP life
AAAAAAAA+++++++++++++++++++++++++
take two
Even though I think a developer could do much more with the insane amount of funds they received for this it's still the game that nailed the experience of the entire battle royale genre the best. I do however also think that epic games has done more for the f2p game fortnite battle royale in a couple of months than these guys have in a year. It is well deserved that fortnite took the crown. I'm eagerly awaiting a response from the devs here.
It's the Hallmark holiday special of video games.
Buy gtaV on LINK REMOVED ezy
Y'all already know why I'm giving this a negative.
madddd game would recomend 10/10
Simply doesn't work for me. No solution found. Waste.
Its fun. sort of silly sometimes. Gives you a rush like the old arcade games way back. Worth it.
A difficult and often frustrating game... but when you get that squad wipe or insane moment it all becomes worth it ). The final circles in the top ten are so intense and fun! Amazing game! Be prepared to lose A LOT lol.
Dear PUBG! I am a pubger who played since the game came out. The test serve recently released which is really hot now. However the game feeling is so freaking suck. I disconnected a couple times during the middle of game. Just now it only 5 people left and I suddently disconnect.Therefore I have to give a bad comment. And one last thing YOU PUBG
Fun to play and keeps you occupied.
good game i like
This is a very good Game
great game but be prepaired for the most toxic player base you have ever seen! every game consists of one conceeded goal followed by a tyrade of troll vomit lol i thought COD had a salty crowd i knew nothing!
big love

It's a very fun game. As in every multiplayer game some russians are screaming in the lobby but the game makes up for that.The best thing in my opoinion is that you see the team working on the game everyday and a (positive) development is visible )

ing amazing game buy it now!
Ban all the Chinese Cheating s (CCC's for short) region lock the servers and fix the performance and I might consider giving this game a positive rating. Tired of not knowing whether or not I'm in an NA server because so many of those Chiners infest them.As of 1.0 release My review still stands. The game is still plagued by bugs and horrid networking. The game is still as stale as ever and filled with cheaters. if you want a good BR game to play until a BR game inevitably gets made on the Frostbite engine go play Fortnite it's free and plays better than PUBG does in its current state.
Okay so... i played the story mode very nice played online literally cheaters everywhere got 1b money drop within the couple hundred hours i played and get a warning for having too much money get it taken away (im not mad this happened its just fair play i shouldnt have 1b for anyreason). i decide to try modding for fun literally the first hour just make my car fly and change colors with 3 of my friends get instantly perma banned like wtf. and i cant appeal because a bunch of dumb kids on youtube make videos saying just lie to get unbanned so then rockstar changes to policy to all bans are final and i got banned before the policy change and cant play online i kinda wanna play again just for fun and drive cool cars. i got banned like 2 years ago and wish i never modded i could still be playing this game it was fun too bad rockstar doesnt care to let me appeal a ban for doing literally nothing that hurt that game.
very good
I'd probably like this gameIF I COULD RUN IT
Unless you like microtransactions and no more single player mods game gets boring grinding and grinding towards nothing
fix server ples capacom
Nice game.Realy nice.But 70% time you connected in 0 2 0 3 0 3 ...game.Balance in game What? Hah No(c).
nice game
no joke honestly the my fav game i have on steam
The strategy that you have to use in order to win! Love it!
"Update 5/13/17Optimization has gotten a lot better. Haven't noticed any frame skipping anymore or rubberbanding. In general things have gotten a lot smoother.Still not a huge fan of the circle speed/timings...but I think I can live with it since everything else in the game has become a lot more playable. Also Devs have added cool things like custom matches. Started playing this game more in Duos than Solo and having a lot more fun that way. So I've changed my recommendation from a No to a Yes.Pre 5/13/17Can't recommend this game in its current state. Optimization is insanely bad frame skipping with a top of the line rig... combine that with rubberbanding servers and you sometimes have games where it's near impossible to hit anybody consistently. Audio cues in general are pretty bad as well. The circle timings seem really poorly thought out. So many games I've played running simulator for the entire game. You don't have time to engage in any fights in between phases or you risk dying very quickly in the ""gas"".I know optimization updates and other changes are in the pipeline... so I can revise my recommendation if those prove to improve quality of life across the board. The Battle Royale genre has such potential... but I think PUBG misses the mark just like H1Z1. Looking forward to what Islands of Nyne can bring to the table. This genre really needs a AAA developer polish. If only Valve or Blizzard would pick it up."
this is gr8
Fun engaging and challenging!
This game takes too long to load and to many cheaters lol dont buy )
The best survival shooter I've ever seen.Don't think too much. Just buy and play. З
Game got old and community is too cancerous. Probably should only be played for drunken split screen fun. Other than that stay away.
Good campaign and fun online
Buy R6Siege Instead

Easily one of the best multiplayer games ever made. I find myself coming back to this game more often then I realized. They could easily do a Tron Light Cycle Mod for this game which would be super cool as well. Or even Disc of Tron like that old stand up arcade game. Which was bad !! Anyways this game rocks plan and simple...
this game sucks. psyonix does nothing to deal with their toxic fanbase. DONT BUY IT
Tom Clancy's Battlefields best ice skating simulator 1.27/3
Much speedier than the PS4 version other than that I m not seeing any differences but those small comparisons people love so much I don t notice really.Was a great game one of the best Grand Theft Autos so far with an online multiplayer with endless upcoming content. 10/10
REGIONLOCK. Hackers can SMD. And Crashing out of the game without being able to rejoin can also SMD. Edited on 2/21/18 It can still SMD
What about rust.This game is great i loved it and failed my exams because of it.Seriously for an early access game i got to say that it's truely good. The aiming with the guns is truely different from the other i find it a bit challenging. And that's fine to me.The building part of the game is pretty fun even though it too easily destroyable by C4 to me.The only think i find pretty bad is the community. A lot a bandits to much for me. And a lot of young player. But to counter that there are a lot off pretty great community servers. You'll be able to talk to anyone around pressing V.Playing on the official server is pretty hard since there is a lot of hacker..Finaly garry's team are realy taking care of their baby got to say thanks to them.Play it you'll love it.
Awesome
can even hunt a monster with friends connection is just sucks never last more then 5 minutes dont waste your money on this stupid game
They should change the name of the game to loading since that is the most used word in the game. with like 70% of the screen time.
Boycotting this game. No mods No fun!!!F U ROCKSTAR AND TAKE TWO
Game is extremely hard on new players. Everyone murders you or steals from you so if you're a solo player don't bother. Game uses a levelling and exp system to limit new players weapons and has no intuitive tutorial on crafting. Several times I harvested materials only to not know how to use them and promptly be murdered so if you just start hit a rock or tree for around 2 hours just to level up.Might as well be DayZ all over again except you can't find weapons and gear you have to be punished until you can punish other new spawns/players
good joke game to play with friendsi cant recommend it for 28 whatsoever (compared to the free alternatives)if you're into the combat in arma and a slower more tactical based battle royale then by all means get this game.Personally though im not a great fan of the slower pace of this game. Everyone ive encountered has shot me from somewhere i cannot see them (leaning behind a tree or hiding in grass using a suppressed weapon) and nearly all my kills are from me hiding in tall grass or in a bush waiting for an unsuspecting player to walk by.im also not a massive fan of the cosmetics system in this game either. I feel at the start everyone looks very similar and once you save up your hard earned bp you end up getting a crate you need a key to open. the basic loot inside these crates i dont exactly like and the neato looking cosmetics are all rare and so have a high value. After they removed the clothing spawns ingame ive never been able to find any neat cosmetics when searching a house (i love the trenchcoat haha) and i dont see why they've done this. Sure it increases normal loot spawns but they can make them seperate and so you find weapons with the clothing.in my last few matches i havent really encountered any noticable bugs. which is a great improvement from when i used to play. The game used to be horrible to play bad fps loads of bugs and the graphics looked like doo doo. However i don't know if anyone else finds that its different for them.Anyhow its a fun lil game. best played with friends. however id wait untill this game goes on sale (if i ever does cos i dont think ive ever seen it on sale)
I don't see what all the hype was about. I was gifted this game from a friend. It's so bad that I wouldn't recommend anyone paying any price to pay this game. Not even $1.
Nonstalgic hits hard on this one......Got my good old youth experience from this bad boy
I would say that there no hack.
Product received for free. DA
for real? no this game sucks i want to play it for a while and i am still waiting before i can join with the servers are to busy its ing annoying i payed 30 euros for this game come on man fornite is free and i never had i problem like this
This game is great.
i just got banned from gta online for being afk for 10 min. yes BANNED for 30 days. what the is that t.
"early access review for the current state of the game I will update it once the game is fully released. Pros Exciting gameplay Fast que times / 100 player matches instantly. Fun Squad based gameplay with 1 or 3 of your friends. ( or MM with strangers ) Good Sized map / easy to navigate. Simple but effective loot system. Unlimited replay value. Rewarding victories 1st &amp 3rd person modesCons Poorly optimized / FPS drops stutters Extremely CPU intensive w/ poor results Hit ditection is terrible at times ( most of the time it's sub par ) Desync ( Iv rarely experienced this but many others have ) Gameplay feels clunky at times especially where jumping is involved. Audio / Directional sound is awful / when it's raining on the map you can hear nothing else. Terrible community ( but this is just gaming in general in 2017 ) Developers banning people for exploiting bugs in early access Developers banning people for "" stream snipping "" Microtransactions in early access after the developer "" promised "" there wouldn't be any until the game was complete Decent amount of cheaters 1 hit kill HS punches ( like why lmao ? ) Melee weapons besides the pan are essentially useless Lack of weapons 5 are only obtainable through random crate drops on the map. Thumbs down but I won't say don't purchase the game it's still fun with all of its current problems but Buyer Beware."
This game is great. A great premise and a great format. There are a few issues but some of them are just inherent to the game itself.1. You're first couple rounds of survivor are actually pretty scary. After about match 10 it just becomes a game a great game but no longer heart pounding scary. So if you have a family member you want to scare the crap out of the investment is well worth it.2. Balance will always be tricky to get just right. The Devs have consistently listened to the community and added great things to the game and adjusted the worst parts. People will complain about Decisive strike and dead hard all day but I still remember when you didn't have any hooks on the map! Good luck killing anyone like that!3. Hook camping is a fun sapper. Since the games inception camping hooks is the biggest complaint I ever had. There really isn't anything the survivors can do about it except keep doing objectives but that makes the gameplay completely boring for the person who got hooked and the killer is actually missing out on tons of BP but they never listen.So I highly recommend this game for everyone except those who are squimish about blood and gore.
A bit boring when ur done with the offline story
game is fun kawkwakwakwkw

I Love This Game
A super fun game you can easily spend a lot of time playing especiall fun with friends.
Game spot on as always came from xb1 and online play is good single player need to know how to mod vehicles and stiff for the single player side of things
I love the idea of this game. Love the desperate feel and the adrenaline. But glitchy?! Oh yes. So so glitchy which takes almost everything away from it. I recommend it only with the hope that there will be fixes in the future.
Rust is gay Cameron
The more you play this game the more you start to hate it it is full of cheaters and the loot system is so ******* BAD.also the random create system just sucks i always get creates with locks on it im not buying youre stupid keys the game is already overprised. they really need to start listening to their community because the game is far away from being successful.
Nice game!
Excellent game if you play FPP at least
Amazing FIFA 23 beta gameplay. Can't wait for FIFA 24...
))
I love the game but its laggy af. I have a GTX 1015 TI graphics card and when i play on the lowest settings in game it cant go above 30 fps and it crashes sometimes.Only play this game if you have a very good computer.sometimes its playable when a server is empty and its ping is lower than 50 i recommend this game for high peformance computers.
noice
Awesome game
All about them Chicken Dinners!!
Awesome game 10/10 Recommend to buy it.. ITS AWESOME!
They added boob physics 11/10
Fun but you get punished for being good at the game.After u reach rank 10 you will never find a game under 400 ping. )
**READ TO END**MY REVIEW A YEAR AGO Like Ive said in some of my other reviews I enjoy games that I keep coming back to time and time again. This game defintely falls under that category. Every match is different Every match is fun and most matches have an element of suspense too.I strongly recommend this game and I strongly suggest you get a couple friends together to play it.NOWI can sadly no longer reccomend this game to ANYONE because of literally countless bugs glitches and honestly the game is just a huge mess. It runs on a HIGHLY modified version of Unreal engine and ill tell you.. it sucks! ever since 1.0 the game has gone severely downhill the devs care only about adding useless t to spark interest in the game while overlooking every single thing that makes the game actually work.In the past year 1. the menu has gone from a clean looking and good sounding place to an utter MESS of adverisements for streamers and new useless features2. the landscape has gone from a vibrant green map to a dull almost smoggy and grey feeling one (and im talking about the same map they just found a way to make it look bad.) 3. countless bugs have arisen due to oversight of worthless devs and worst of all Brendon Greene himself.But what really bothers me is that not only is the game a dumpster fire but the devs just sit there and watch it burn and the features they add are just adding fuel to the flames. THE DEVS JUST DONT CARE but worst of all they still want $30 for their game that is currently on life support.
lol
GREAT GAME GO BUY IT. LIKE RIGHT NOW SERIOUSLY ANYONE WHO BUYS THIS GAME WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH IT!
Hi I'm the worst RL player in the universe. But I still swear that this game is really fun somehow.
"You'd think that a game wich is petty much just ""soccer with cars"" would be really boring. But you'd be wrong. The game look gorgeous and it's a loot of fun. New stuff is added all the time."
Muy Buen Juego. Vale la pena. Lo único malo es que no puedes usar el micrófono en all (todos) hasta que pase un minuto de la partida.
"this game is great. if it works. honestly it has SO many issues with controllers. it has so many issues with computers in general. be ready to get frustrated at ""rocket league has stopped working"" crashes and stuff. even happens in the middle of a game."
is bad
DON'T BUY THIS THE FRAME RATE IS A PEICE OF A WASTE OF MY MONEY THE GAME SEEMS COOL BUT YOU CANT EVEN PLAY IT
Well 100 hours in and I still can't recommend this game. You crash wayyyyyy too often. You set a trap you crash you hook someone you crash you pick up someone you crash. It's just crash report after crash report with nothing getting fixed. The only time it doesnt crash is when youre playing survivor and you just cant win survivor at least not as easily as a killer. You'll constantly be matched with rank 1 killers and just get creamed. The game runs like even on good cards and the devs dont seem to give a . The learning curve is steep. I guarentee you'll ing hate this game when you start. There are still numerous bugs and balance issues and the community is still a steaming pile of So there. No I can't recommend this.
ing motorcycles
Honestly i was afraid when they say MH W required powerful cpu and gpu. Perhaps if you want to max out all setting it is true. Alas I'm just a peasant but honestly it runs fine with medium high setting with 900p on my AMD A8 6600 with gtx660 and 8GB of ram. No issue but yeah rendering is somewhat as expected from old rig is not with the speed of light.I agree with multiplayer issue. It's hard to join multiplayer session though the other way around is that you can create your own multiplayer session but with no one join you can only help those who send out sos flare. I would really like dev team to fix this ASAP.
The best version of GTA V you can get hands down great single player and online play. I would recommend this game to any of my friends no problem. If you're a fan of GTA this is the game to have!
Nice game ever
damn good game well worth the money the story is good but the real prize is online
Yes
its good.
A blast and a half. Go killer when starting to get used to maps and game.
Best game
Its pretty good they have to sort out the lag at the start of rounds though
"Just got the game and already love it. This is definitly the best Battle royal game on the market! This game is intense and brutal but thats what makes it so fun! I started my first game and died and then i jump back into my game immeditly with almost no wait time. I havent experienced any hackers like so many people are saying are in ""every game"". Thats just not true. When i die i acutally feel like i was out skilled rather than out lucked. Fortnite for example 90% of the kills (mine included) are pure luck. This game acutally takes skill and knowing what kind of guns you have and what scopes go good with them. Great game and I am so glad that they are adressing all the ""hackers in every game"" so fast."
rock.
RAELLY NOIC GAEM ME LAJEK IT ETZ GUT
If you continue to upload many more expensive items that nobody needs instead of fixing your game.PUBG will remain forever a dead game
I'm not a modder not for GTA. I've dabbled in it once in Single Player but that's becuase it ran dry of content. They moved to Multiplayer to add content. So there is content IN THE GAME that people who paid FULL PRICE for the SINGLE PLAYER game can't play. Now there's a cease and desist for the biggest modding engine in the game that almost every mod runs on. They're saying that modding the games we bought is illegal. I am NOT standing for that garbage. LOOK HOW MANY HOURS I HAVE. I clearly love GTA but I'm uninstalling after this. Screw whatever money grabbing snobs made this decision and until it's fixed SCREW GTAV.
F***ing Cant even get a refund. LAG LAG LAG Cant connect to servers Chinese bombing the servers and laging the game Chinese 360 no scope across the map to get a head shot getting shot from under the map LAG more LAG.
Amazing game in more people
holly funny .It's very difficult but very funny
pretty good game
I have heard a lot about this game. I really want to play it but it will not load me into ANY servers. I am about ready to give up on it. All I want to do is play it and I can't even load into it to try it. Any advise from anyone???
Played GTA V lost touch with reality.Played GTA Online lost faith in humanity.
Hello everyone When PUBG first came out I was not really interested in it because at the time I was playing more of CSGO. I eventually bought the game however in December of 2017 and I haven't looked back since. I have been enjoying this game so much due to its uniqueness (PlayerUnknown was the first guy to introduce the battle royale genre in gaming even though he did so in ARMA first). After having 485 hours on the game here are some things that I find great about this game and other things which need improvement. The main reason that I love this game is that it is different every time you play it. I haven't had the final circle end at the same exact location ever since I bought this game which means that every time I queue up for a game there's an element of surprise of what I will encounter. I think this is the more significant point for me because I'm not constantly running towards the same area but rather get to explore different parts of the map and battle other players differently each time depending on where the encounter occurs. In addition since I bought this game there have been numeours updates to it (majority of which have been beneficial) so from that you can see that the developers somewhat care about this game and are constantly pushing out new updates. PUBG has come a long way since it was first released and since I bought it. At the time there were only two available maps (Miramar and Erangel) and some aspects of the game were different as well. Vehicle physics bullet penetration and the maps themselves were all different and have been modified in a positive way since then. Vehicles used to be extermely unsturdy and easy to flip but thankfully they have been fixed since then. Some things that could be improved are that the weapon spawn rate should be increased on Erangel and the game still is not fully optimized as it should be. I along with majority of the other players have mini stutters at times which can become annoying. They don't occur all the time though but it would be nice if the developers fixed this issue once and for all. I don't like the Sanhok map but that's personal preference. The game can be very frustrating at times but that's just the nature of the game since you're always competing againsts 100 other players (if playing solo). However most of the time it is an extrordinary game that really gives you an adrenaline rush when the player count starts getting below 10.
A shooter survival game could be betterPlease fix bugs and optimize )
This has to be the best game ever made. I played the solo campaign on my PS3 and completely loved it. Now I'm stuck in GTA online. Great game lots of stuff to do! Very addictive.
I have beaten this game at least three times on my ps4 now I'm looking to beat it many times on this pc! Highly recommend there is always something to do in GTA V no matter how many times you beat it. At times missions are not very similiar as they have thier own kick to each one. which keeps you on your toes. 8/10
Game is absolute garbage. Had potential yet the developer is so garbage they seem to make everything worse. Everyday i log in knowing my pc is gonna be treated like a senior in a AP Trigonometry class on the brink of suicide thanks to the fact that even on low settings the game still murders my pc. The chinese have infected this game to the maximum. At least 20 cheaters a game. R E G I O N L O C K C H I N A. Its not racist its a pretty well known fact amongst A L L G A M E R S. They cheat. The game requires like 16gb of RAM MINIMUM constantly force quits istelf and freezes to the point to where you have to either restart your cpu or sign out and sign into your acc. The game has been in early access forever and even upon its release its like almost nothing has changed. Game overall is bad. Dont let watching shroud or dr disrespect cheat you out of $30. Wait for it to be fixed or join the cancer like we did.
R.I.P. OpenIVEdit Still.
Epic game w8ing for the mp update
Forget about making goals.You'll get an erection by just touching the ball
No mods allowed

although i enjoy the game quiet much the performance and optimization are such a turn off as if there are not enough games that never left this stage of development i am fearful this game will see the same fate i am running the game on i5 4690 and gtx 980 strix game is installed on 850pro ssd still experiencing too many frame drops and very weak performance during battles i find my self entering a building where i know the enemy location and i instantly get my screen freeze for a second 99% of the times where fight starts in a building losing all advantage i come to hold to bad performance and freezes.i wouldent reccommend this game at this stage unless you have faith in your specs to run this smooth (i run all settings on low and distance is on ultra).on the game itself its addictive and very rewarding could get your heartbeat to the sky close quarters on the other hand is where who has better PC wins this is how it feels at the moment the reason i cant recommend it at this moment is becausei have never seen an early access game that ran so flawed and eventually patched into a performance beast its the core of this game using very lame engine unlike battlefield where if you found the right settings for your specs you could ping your mouse with your finger and see how smooth the screen moves even with all kind of things going on in it i decided to write this review so you can save yourself from another disappointment if you are planning to play this on the long term if you have a beast PC you can definitely find joy in this game as it is now.
Best Loading Screen SimulatorBest Getting Killed By Other Players Cause Why Not Simulator
yes
overrated garbage
take 2 greedy
Awesome game. Easy to pick up and start but difficult to master. There's always something new to learn.Great thing about it is you can play it in short bursts and you can have fun even if you are loosing (at least I can).Competitive mode is great and queue times are short. Great game and a lot of fun.It's better with a friend (IMO) but you can play it alone and have a lot of fun.Buy this game! You won't regret it.
by far one of the greatest games in terms of fun and competition and should be a game on everyone's xmas list
So this game still plays like sh*** they mistakenly ban tons and tons of players because they thought they were cheating has tons of bugs/issues yet they still release a $10 DLC before fixing sime things?!? LOL such a money grab. Can't wait for this developer &amp game to finally go under. They screwed up BIG time with the development &amp priogression of this game.
Fantastic Game!
THIS GAME INNGGGG SUUUCCCCCCCCKKKKKSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Really good game it's not a game you would play 24/7 It's a game you play when you are bored.
Hackers aren't as freaquent as most say found at least 2 hackers in the 250 or so hours I put into this game. 10/10 would recommend Ign
Some dude hijacks my account plays only PUBG. I get my account back sees a vac ban on record from PUBG. I don't play it anymore. Removes it from account. What a great game.
Game is full of Hackers. Dont buy it unless your into that sort of thing.
The wait was more than worth it. Definitely buy this game regardless of whether you have it on potato gen or not.
"Before updating FPS 80 120............................. After updating 15 20 ? really ???Don't ask for my PC spec mine can run your family over 150FPS at Ultra P PP/s dont buy this game till the Devs can ""ACTUALLY"" finish this sh****t !!!!!!!!!!"
It feels very annoying when you get to endgame and just die to hackers 1 out of 2 games. This game used to be fun.
Once you Rocket you just can't stop it. Literally. Send help.
Such as fun game to play yes it has it's bugs but it's early access what else do people expect I say this game ghas been worth every penny I paid.
Great Graphics And Game Design However Can Become Repetitive _
Game that looks simple when buying but proves to become a game of solid thought for newer players to manoeuvre their way through these maps. Enjoyable team game for those who play in the survivor role and a solid solo game for those wanting to kill online randoms. Good graphics and gameplay with little bugs would recommend to try this game out for the adrenaline that comes with it. Great fun )
One of the best games I've ever played
game but I'm gonna buy it again lel xD
this game has improved and declined over the yearsbut it's been heavily optimized and now runs really well on my computerand im addicted again
RIP GTA V
"It was fun for the first couple of weeks that it came out but I became very bored of it after I saw how quickly you can obtain ""End Game"" tier loot. Hopefully they'll make it more challenging in the future.Good game until you find an M4. 3/10"
Capcom has no idea how to communicate properly to their customers. They DONT read Steam or their own website like EVER. The only way to even communicate issues at all is via an automated email system. They promised that patient pc players (after waiting for 7 months) would get things faster. After having announced KT delay and crippling the festival content I WILL NOT recommend that anyone buy this. WAIT A YEAR. Then buy it in a bargain bin. at that point the dev will have decided to stop trickling content and the modders will have fixed the remaining glitches.
Wanted to just send the developers a quick message but there is no easy way to do that. Love the game. But i really like it when my internet studders for a minute then the game kicks me out for 15 minutes. Thanks Rocket League great job
Playerunknown's Battlegrounds short as PUBG is a FPS battleroyale game. The goal in this game is to be the last one alive. You can play this game with 2 3 friends in a squad match with 1 friend in duos or just alone in solo match. First you drop in from an airplane that goes different routes over the map every time you jump in a match the plane's course will be different. Then you can jump off the plane to an nearby location and loot up. The game offers a large amount of weapons to find on the map or find from the lootdrops that a plane drops occosially during the match. You can find different rifles shotguns pistols sniper rifles and SMGs. And you can find crossbows too but you know... (nobody uses it because its bad). In the lootcrates that the plane drops you can find some high tier weapons such as lightmachine gun other really good automatic rifles and some really good sniper rifles. You can also find weapon attachments around the map (you usually can find loot in houses and large citys' or towns). Some of the attachments you can find are suppressors for different gun types grips other muscle attachments stocks different sights such as a 2 4 8 or 15 times scopes and larger clips or clips that can be reloaded faster. You can also find 3 different helmets kevlars and backpacks to fit all your ammo in. And you also can find medkits larger medkits painkillers energydrinks? and a medical syringe. There are also cars and motorbikes around the map (Usually near houses and roads).You can also drive a boat and a water scooter. After you've geared up the next phace in the game is to move to an safe zone market as a big white circle in the map. You have to get inside the safe zone before you get inside the blue circle or also known as electric wall that will do more damage as the game progresses. The circle will shrink and change location so be aware of that. After every match no matter did you win or lose you will recieve battlepoints as a reward how good you did during that match. Battlepoints are calculated from your damage and what you placed during that game. (Example If you placed 87th you won't be getting too many battlepoints compared to if you placed 1st).There are also two maps you can play on one is a forest themed map and the other one is a desert themed map also there is third one in the making! (Its going to be a jungle themed map)Now for the goods and bads of this game + for good and for bad.+Really fun to play with friends+Really good gun gameplay+Vaulting is really useful and fun+Realy good map desings for both maps+Good bullet physics+Not too complicated controls+Many weapons and attachments to chooce from+Really good graphics (I mean this doesn't really matter for most of the people but I decided to put it in anyways)+Overall good gameplay Broken car physics Many hackers (I haven't countered as much as some people have) Heavy input lag Bad sound design (Sometimes you hear a shot from left and instantly after that you get killed by the same guy you thought shot you from the left from behind of you.) Slow paced gameplay (Games can take up to 40minutes)
nice game
This is a great game but the major problems that exist are probably not going to be fixed not because the PUBG team doesn't want to fix them but because they revolve around massive amounts of players using the game at the same time. This mainly includes server lag and hosting issues. There are invisible objects in the new map that I've found driving up mountains in cars that don't affect player entities. They do affect bikes trucks and minibuses. This is an example of a problem that just comes with having such a massive map and not enough testing to fix all of the little problems. As for the gameplay itself I would recommend PUBG to GROUPS of friends. Playing by yourself isn't anywhere near as much fun as going for a backflip in a bike in the final circle with a friend stuck on the back who can't get off. The guns handle well but it can be hard to get used to the shooting as there isn't anywhere to really practice.
Product received for free. good

good casual game
BEST GAME EVAR I PLAYD IN PC GOOD JOB ROCKSTAR
I would say this game sucks but with my in game hours almost nearing the 800 hour mark I'd rather say that I'm a sucker for this game. 10/10 would play 5/10 would stay and 2/10 would actually git gud.
Footprint Hunter Disconnection.Well acutally i still enjoy the game since i'm always a lone wolf that doesn't have friends to play with. Sad.
Great game its really fun and had great gameplay and customizablity you can play with keyboard or you can use controller which is great but if youre using a ps4 controller it still has the xbox hints such as A instead of X or X instead of square
R star s server dog you know wt Im not meant that all of these like dog I just want to tell you guys wt is truth.
This is the one game I keep coming back to.Guess you can call this game my dirty pleasure.
Product received for free. A must get for anyone really nice community and a fun experience
Product received for free. good
This game is my worst steam purchase and worst purchase in last 5 years. Too many bugs in the game. And I am being killed in every other game by impossible shots. Hacking is a big issue in this game and I don't think PUBG will ever be free of hackers who take all the joy out of the game
Not worth $20 but it is fun.Edit If you are going to increase the price of the game by 175% (35$) PLEASE ADD SINGLE PLAYER OR NEW FEATURES.
First GTA game i've ever play was not dissapointed at all. This game is extremely fun.
6/5
I have proven that you can play this game on a rather pc. Very well optimized.
This game is defiantly worth the 20 dollars but I must warn you that you will have no life after play this game you will really forget everything even your life will be sucked it.
Amazing keep and you keep improving every day doesn't bore you either11/26/2018 Still playing it and they are still doing great small tweak!
Can you guys optimize your game? I mean that's like step one. UPDATE PC no longer a potato good game.
yes
A lot of work was put into this game that we play today. I remember playing the beta and for a time i did not like the new Rust. So legacy was still available. And awesome game to be sure. You will find friendly and agressive people there. but you are sure to have a great time.
I was coming here to tell you that you're bad at your job but I cannot I simply cannot....
Much better game than fortnight battle royale and h1z1 king of the kill.
Just bad
starts a fire. its litu got it? xdddddddddd
I would have normaly said i liked this game but affter the utter crap the take two interactive pulled i would never recemend this game to anyone
No the GTAV became stupid cashgrab on online. Offline is OK but online declined in quality.
This review used to be positive but the game honestly sucks. Too luck based too buggy too t. Better off playing a shooter where you respawn and things actually happen besided running around for extended periods of time and randomly dying.The above was from like a year or two ago. UPDATE BELOW.Hackers still everywhere.Came back to play some matches and played like 12 hrs between today and yesterday. Every single game everyone always knows where you are and are near 100% accurate even with automatic fire from over 100m away even it you have lvl 3 everything and your squad is all super geared someone will just be behind a rock in the middle of nowhere pop out and kill your whole 4 man instantly. Not worth your time.
Changed Thumbs down to thumbs up. Servers improved significatnly. Although theres some bugs here and there but its def gotten lot better.
I've mostly played online which is fun. I've noticed playing with friends is way more fun but the pubs seem decent enough. The story I'm saving for another time but is very fun to play to where I got. Worth full price? I don't think it is now the hype died down a little. Multiplayer had a severe hacking problem and at this point seems very lackluster for the price. Payday 2 is a much better heist game.
IF MY GAME CRASHES ONE MORE TIME I WILL LOSE MY GODDAMN MIND!!!
Well the concept is good but the game is not confusing as hell and poorly constructed. Now i dont have much time in the game because its hard to get into theres no map very glitchy and laggy (and its not my computer i have a 2014 alienware mx17). Also the resources (other than wood) are SUPER hard to find. I have played 1.5 hours so far and have yet to find stone/ores its impossible. Many feel the same via chat. RECCOMENDATION TO THE MAKERS Please please please add a map for starters first thing hands down next make resources easier to find and mabey even a different color than the mountain of boulders. The game is just to hard in the beggining very frustrating and discouraging. Lag and glitches seem to be the norm so mabey limit the amount of players in a server and reduce some detail. My setting is on fastest and its still horrible. In conclusion i think you have a great idea and i do reccomend the game based on the vision but as far as were is stands now I do not reccomend to people this game at its current stage it definatly is not worth $20 as it is.

Awesome game servers. Cant wait for it to run smooth
i build a base i got so much stuf and when i come back to my base i was dead not so good game (
We bought this game on PC for one reason. Singleplayer mods. Rockstar and Take Two. RIP OpenIV.
Roading and rag
just OMG 10/10
Nice
Very good game with some extra stuff like being penetrated by a pan &lt 3
Wipes aside you won't find any other game out there about beating naked people with rocks.
BE WARNED The developers can and will ban you for no reason with no avenue for appeal.I was lucky one of the pubg community managers on reddit was able to have my ban overturned (whilst bluehole support told me revoking bans was impossible) I have been unbanned now (no apology from them for the wrongful ban) but this experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth.
Game is good once you've played a bit. The playerbase is toxic as though so it is not really worth your time to start playing it.
Fun untill you get shot in the head from no where then your off until your in a game again looting then you do it all over again
On behalf of the OpenIV team you.
Practically pay to play wish they'd allow mods.
Nice horror game. worth 10 bucks on sale.
AMAZING!!!!!!!
It's OK.
Product received for free. scarry game!!!
"The game that the PC needed for a long time...After playing Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate on the Wii U. I wanted to play with friends on the PC at some point.Then played Dauntless (at first it was fun but it was actually a terrible designed game).Monster Hunter world came out... Alot more fun than dauntless.The main point of the game is Kill stuff make gear to kill better and harder stuff to improve your character. Skills are tied to your armour and weapons so equip the right stuff for enemies to make it easier. The best thing about the game is the ecosystem mechanics. When you explore around the map there is a ""Food chain"" where certain enemies will react differently to each other. 2 or more monsters are more likely to have turf war where one will do more damage to the other. This will guarantee material drops from creatures which is useful in the later game.People will complain about this game about Denuvo but who actually gives a flying about it. Multiplayer is a pain in the to connect as you have to find your friends in the ""Bulletin board"" and find the right session stuff. If only you could stay in a party forever (even in the main lobby) but it's a small price to pay for a good game.Try as many weapons as possible to test your play style. Different weapons will suit different battles. Bows if you need to attack certain parts. The Insect Glaive if you want to mount the creature to slow it down. The combinations should be used in tandom with what you think would assist with the battles. (Just remember the first 2 areas are ground based enemies and the later areas introduce more flying enemies)."
Trash devs trash game.
Nice
uhhhhhhh...
Fortnite but for people with money
Mintt love the saltyness after a good raid
This game is full of hackers. Everywhere. There hasnt been any game development since they released the early access. The Developers got their cash grab and completely abandoned the game. While it IS fun when you have a private server you rent it becomes a 24/7 babysitting job to keep all the kids Russians and 3rd world hackers from destroying everything while you are not on the server..... It has the most hackers of any game I have ever seen and the Devs do not seem to care.
"We Spawned. We were naked. We had rocks torches and nowhere to go. me and my friend sprinted off into the distance flapping in the wind as we ran looking for hemp wood and a place to call home. After being on the run gathering resources for a few hours we decided to pitch up tent next to a rock. We had sleeping bags and after 3 hours of flapping about finally made some trousers and hid our manhood from one another. The next couple of hours took a turn for the worst. someone was knocking at the door...one man slamming our (wrongly placed) backwards door down screaming some hateful words of death through the keyhole. I looked at my half nude friend...surely our time is up? surely we are done for? We built a home here We slept here even made our first pair of pants together here...all for this our sure demise.Wait gunshots...and the agonising scream of a man. Then the door flies off and enter two men that had saved our lives.""hello kind sirs"" i say ""hello"" they reply""you have saved us we owe you our life!""after this we decided to travel with our new friends and watch them slaughter half the server with weapons we could only dream of having smashing down doors killing nude men. I couldnt help to think that only 4 hours ago i was one of those nude men just looking for a place to call home and some pants.Our story ends here still on the run still half naked and still yet to find someone other than the two heros of the story that dont want to blow our heads off.7/10 would buy again."
T2. This game is easily one of the best games i've ever played but T2.
This game is too good.
Buy this game if you like Lag input High ping No shot/hit registration Bad hitbox Bad netcode Hackers Barely no kills and instant death because all of the above.
Screw these s. Don't support their BS.
Love This game
Just like ye ol' days with SuperSonic Aerobic Rocket Powered Battle Cars. But with csgolotto.
Really fun game to play excpecially with friends it can be stresfull if you are sat all night playing ranked and still cant get you rank up but all in all it is a fun adictive silly game
For the love of god fix the issue with first aid kits not finishing. SO MANY TIMES they've just canceled out of the blue or dissapeared without healing me for
Wow.Not played in a while. Turns out to be more toxic than overwatch.
Great game really fun and is a great party game. Also very good for competetive gaming.
Can't even play it does even pass the seting up game for the first time trying to download something i already have and i cant even get a refund thanks steam
do you want to have a chicken din din? just buy this game and you will got your chicken. D

Excellent game
Amazing! Low skill floor high skill ceiling!
damn this is creepy af
Plain and simple. Would not buy again. It went from a fun game that brought you and friends to work as a team to get the dinners. Now is just a bunch money grabbing from the company and losers who think skins make them not losers. Crates used to be earned not bought. Once they changed that it all went downhill.
gud
I highly recommend this game for the story mode. Its insanely fun and beautifully done. One of the best games ever.As far as online I have spent plenty of hours online and it has given me so much entertainment. The thing is this issue with modding software. It happens way too often where you are in a server and someone is modding and causing problems. There is nothing you can do but report the suspected person or join a new lobby. This is highly frustrating that we have to deal with it on a daily basis in almost every server. Not very fun to lose a big sale because 6 random vehicles spawned on top over you and everyone in the server. This has RUINED the online experience!!!!Story mode is amazing and definitely worth playing worth the money. Online is very good if you can tolerate the modding that happens. Or the kids begging for free money. These are huge negatives for me in the online and I just returned with the new DLC after a long break. I recommend this game now for the beauty and story but I warn you the online experience will vary and you will likely find yourself jumping servers frequently to avoid modding and griefing. Grow up kids!
Very naise i luv pigs n diamond swords n also respecting wamen
10/10 would pass out at 2 00 AM again
Fast Tactical Gameplay with your buds or solo......cant beat it!!
This game has so much going for it the grind the building but guess what if you didnt start playing back when it came out then dont play it cause every one with guns kills every one and take your rock and torch just for and giggles. 4 hours of work can go right down the drain if you die cause it spawns you at random points in the map. 2/10
AFTER 6 MONTH WAITING ITS FINALY HERE I LOVE IT!
so nc
Amazing game!! You can play it with up to 4 friend. great long distance shooting battles! MUST HAVE!!
Pretty Good But It Needs To Be Optimized

Bedt game that come too live this car are real believe me i saw it they played football outside of my house
Very nice game. There are some bad people (who kos you kill on sight ) while there are the good people (who give you a base and part of their group now).I recommend and its pretty fun for me.
Very good game
Great game love it
I really have enjoyed my time so far in gta to be honest l havent done much of the campaign because l hoped straight onto online. Onlone is fun and exciting with many things to do but rockstar have made this game into a grind for cash which is not enjoyable new heist would nice to be added. So in the end l give this game 6/10 but don't recommend getting it of you don't have time to grind heist import/export etc.
This GTA best GTA.Also best game in general.
So I logged into my account one day and I am VAC banned for cheating .. yet I dont even have the game installed on my pc well updated. So ya how can I get a ban for a game that isnt even updated on my pc. In 1 year of owning the game I have 5 hours of game time so that right there tells you that i don't play it on top of that I play a lot of FACEIT and I have the anti cheat for faceit and never been banned .. I opened a support ticket and all pubg tells you is that they can't tell you anything lol so yea dont buy this crappy game.
THIS GAME IS SOOO GOOD THAT EVEN DEADPOOL HIMSELF PUTS IT ABOVE CHIMI F*CKING CHANGAS!10/10
Rocket League is team based game where you play football with cars. You can run it pretty much on every computer thesedays. You have also ranks and tons of different modes. I like this game and i can recommend it to everyone. Like it!
If you love mods you've come to the wrong place.
Best Game Ever
Take two pls
I en love chode ur game is so much fun!
this game is not recommended by my because i died by a macho bear
Buggy game...the game have lots of bugs and need some optimization in graphics....
no other game makes your heart beat as fast as this one will when you win a chicken dinner.
Product received for free. Very good game I would suggest this to any kind of gamer. But what would be better is that crates are easier to get and that you dont have to buy keys to open them.
it is a great fun game but i can not recomend it because of how broken it is devolopers are focusing on in game stuff we dont care about instead of trying to fix the game and optimizing it
Fun
Insane game get it asap
R* are bae
Although I am not good at the game I still quite enjoy it. It does have a few bugs but we have to remember that the PUBG team is a small crew and it is still in its early stages. I will continue to grow a polish. I hope this game will see many years because it is amazing.
Really nice game!!!
希望赶紧把外挂制裁了吧
A typical 30 minute period on Rocket League for me.Enters casual 2v2 game game already at 4 0 leaves game enters casual 2v2 game game already at 0 9 leaves match enters casual 3v3 game game gets cancelled enters casual 2v2 game game already at 7 2 leaves match enters casual 3v3 game game finally starts 4 of 6 players leave match in first 30 seconds leaves match enters competive 2v2 team member rage quits after 0 1 and leaves ranked match I win 2 1 in OT enters casual 2v2 match....FINALLY EVERYONE STICKS AROUND FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE MATCH. After that match I've honestly had enough of the game and at that point exits game. Man I love this title.
This game is just amazing! The story mode is interesting and cool and the online mod is very funny and there is a lot of things to do!
First bought this game as the Collectors Edition on xbox 360 was quite fun.Played it on PC a year and a half later and it seems like a completely new game.Graphics are awesome and the optimization is pretty much perfect. Running at 60fps+ is a dream in this game. Worth the wait! 9/10
i got banned
Fun but buggy as hell
Great game very reccomended
Best Battle Royale game out there.
Flai sohai
Dear Take Two Interactive you ed up
I would recommend this game however steam should make a Mac version
Don't see why this game has bad reviews. It's millions better than Fork Knife. Just add back rain and fog please...
I had a job and friends once.... Then this game came out..... So much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fix your game....
This is by far the best game I have ever played. It's skill based so you have to spend a lot of time practicing one thing but once you get good at it it feels so good. Recommend to about anyone whether you want to be a top player or just wanna goof around with friends.
This game is a laggy mess. It is poorly optamized and crashes on any pc. How far you can go depends on how much ram you have. I had more fun playing with a pile of $h1t. It wazs fun at first but as the updates rolled out it became worse and worse. right now the game is also taking weeks to release the patch killing my hype. Let me know if anyone has similar issues.
500+ hours later and i'm still loving this game.
Very addictive and fun game. Hopefully they get rid of the lootboxes in the game because that's the only complaint I have about it.
It's just about the microtransactions at this point. No mods ever skyrocketing prices for everything. It's just not GTA anymore. I don't feel like I'm a criminal anymore. I feel like I'm grinding to pay rent. Would have recomended this game a year ago but with it's change in focus over the past year I just can't anymore (which breaks my heart as a long time fan from the begining). I really hope Take2 is paying attention. I may not buy future games if they're all going to be like this.
I honestly WANT to love this game. I enjoy the Battle Royale concept and this game has the best gunplay out of all the BRs I've tried and tested up to this point. Unfortunately the developers who created this game have a LONG way to go when it comes to optimization community approval and just generally making this game what it has EVERY ability to be.There are quite a few issues plaguing this game in it's current state. The optimization needs an overhaul. Frame drops desync rampant exploitation of known glitches you name it they've got it. I have avoided writing a review on this game up to this point because they were doing better about updating the game weekly and fixing SOME of the optimization issues seen in the past. I really thought the developers were starting to get to a point where they could give the community what the community wanted. Now however the developers have announced that this is the second week we will see no updates.I can't give a recommendation for this game in it's current state and that's unfortunate. When this game DOES work it works very very well. The gameplay and the graphics are great and I enjoy playing the game quite a bit however if you aren't ready to deal with a large amount of cheating/glitching/bugging/crashing don't buy/install this game just yet. Give it time and hope (like I have) that the developers will get their resources together and make this game GREAT.Last thing to toss into this review Many have already mentioned this but it deserves repetition. Bluehole is currently charging $30 for this game. They also have multiple in game crates/keys/cosmetic items that cost money. So you have to ask yourself with how much money they are bringing in from this game HOW have they not dedicated some of that to hiring a team with enough experience to FIX the bugs and FIX the cheating.I honestly hope they make this game more playable and more enjoyable. I'd hate to see this game lose it's potential due to developers being unwilling/unable to fix well known issues. Fingers crossed...
good game
Great game so addicting.
+
Pee your pants Take2
Overwhelmingly Negative
I'll be blunti have spent a lot of time in this game and it is very addictive however there are many things that need fixing although i have found myself immersed in the gameplay as both killer and survivor so for the amount of money i spent it was definitley worth it so it deserves a positive rating
total poop
Pretty decent. Has some chug but not as bad as I was expecting given the negative reviews. Runs smooth enough. Can be frusturating if you let it get to you gotta take it in stride and remember its just a game.
Best server performance.eSports ready.
Company being so hostile to modders destroying the longevity of the game.
good game imo
worst community I have ever seen dont buy it unless you wont to get cancer
Best Monster Hunter game for sure. So many quality of life changes that make MH series that much better but lets be clear older MH games are still fantastic! This game just make them easeir to get into than all the past games by a mile. Few weeks in we still have some networking bugs. I have yet to see a crash but I did get the latest video drivers prior to playing so no issues there. Honestly the port to PC in my eyes is fantastic minus the multiplayer issues with disconnects and not being able to connect with friends some times. Highly recommend the game even in its current form. Don't let all the negative reviews disuade you lets face it those people are still playing 5+ hours a day with their negative review because this game is that good. They just want it patched faster!
take2
very bad optimised and still no improvement since early access and developers only care about their micro transactions instead of improving the game. Having to pay 30 bucks and then locking all new content behind paywalls and lootboxes is just ridiculous. besides that it's just not fun. would not recommend
Plays online with a buddy goes to his apartment and get drunk as hell on wine and whiskey. Then we take a hit from the bong and go to the bedroom we kill eachother and our bodys fall out of the window. 1337/420 would get drunk again.EDIT It's actually really good don't check my game hours but instead make your's higher.also this t about 25discount on 80 dollars or something dont ask me about it since i was busy playing the game while that happend Sincerely Eriqoua Darkyfox Sweden
Horribly optimized game and will probably never be done another money crate game. With garbage hitreg
Tense games that are great with friends. Even playing solo is a blast but it doesn't compare if you can get a few friends together.
垃圾 游戏
pretty good
This game is lit kind of need a good computer to get really nice settings I mean a really good computer
This game is amazing for an alpha.
Taking away modding. R*
Ilove this game
屌鸡巴游戏不卡会死 操你妈傻逼游戏我日你妈血逼 brendan greene你妈死了灵车漂移你爸死了坟头蹦迪 你姐大逼被我狂操你妹屁眼被我捅爆 素质王
Never was in to the online side of the game But as for story mode this game delivers!
This game is so much fun. It's soccer... but with cars. It's one of those games where even if you're in that situation where you gotta play alone it's still super fun. Well priced. Graphics are great. Gameplay Mechanics are awesome. Easy to learn. Super fun to play. Even better with friends. Highly recommend this game. 10/10 for sure
"So finally they are taking a stance on hackers and doing somethin about it and people get upset knowing they dident really like you modding single player anyway even if it was for youtube. Thou I did encounter a hacker since they did this dropping missles from the sky hitting my apartment while i was in it.Other than that the game has tons of free dlcs in the online portion of the game and some of the content in single player ""thou dont know why all of its not in single player"" and has a great storyline and plenty to do worth the price.Old Review ""Hackers everywhere no mods allowed even in single player they really ate all the fun out of this game. Plus microtransactions."""

"I loved this game! Emphasis on ""loved"" Introduce micro transactions and servers are laggy as hell right now! SINCE YOU GOT LOOT CRATES NOW! I'm going back to CSGO at least it doesn't lag as much as this. Please prioritize optimization you made more money than any big production company could ever dream of you were the little guy... COME BACK TO US!"
Open IV is gone and so am I. Bring it back and I will delete this review but with out modding GTA is crap.

Great game would recomend its a little buggy but its very fun
The community is ruining the game camping 24/7 teams in solo almost 20 cheaters every game.Edit Weapon's damage distance and travel speed are the shitiest ever made ARS are desbalanced between them loot spawn is like 1% in one house and 99% in the next one the map is too big for only 100 people. Just playing it for money.Edit2 Physics are horrible. And seems like upper neck isn't part of the head. Dsync is cancerous free ping servers make it worst. It doesn't matter what weapon you're using weapons are random they had something like a random damage value between 18 23 for example. Scar L can't one shot a helmetless man p911 can. New anti cheat isn't the answer it doesn't even work got cheated 2 matchs in a row almost all of the cheaters are chinese just make them play in their own server.Edit3 Shotguns can one shot lvl 3 helmets while a kar98k and m24 can't. There are still cheaters around. Seems like your character stuck things inside the car so it keeps moving even when you're not inside.Edit4 SMGs have more damage than ARs if you want to duel someone make sure you're the one with the smg Seems like ARs (Scarl L to be more specific) has a random damage if it land a headshot it's between 90 and 110 lucky will be the factor that decides if you kill him or not Optimized like and lots of bugs and fps drops Cars spawn after you land on the ground you can't see them from the air unless you have a 1080ti (Pay 2 win) Shotguns one shot lvl 3 helmets so you can just pick a shotgun and stay in a 1x1 house Teams in solo 4 guys teaming in duos and also more than 6 players teaming in squad.
Fun
Nice game!
Bought the game for full price + DLCPros Fun to play with friends!Stars are adjusted to number of players playingGraphics and soundtrack are greatAddition of the new 4th star is a wonderful challengeCons Boring to play by selfLack of workshop? Was hoping to get custom maps to extend the gameplaySome lag for friends who connectOverall not a bad purchase definitely caused a lot of frustration and yelling but it is very addictive!
"The biggest problem is all of the cheaters. I've owned it for about a week and I've noticed the same names over and over. Whatever passes for ""anti cheat"" for them clearly doesn't exist. Tell me how a guy that I can barely see with my x4 scope can hurl a grenade right at my feet and have it blow in under two seconds. Hitting the ground and blowing up before I can put the third shot into him with a semi.Even the people who clearly have 0 recoil don't get a slap on the writ. I know they say an update to their anti cheat is coming but I'm doubtful.So until they can get the basics that every other multiplayer shooter has I can't recommend anyone get it at this price. For a multiplayer only game where the entire point of playing in a squad is to die like a bunch of monkies that stole my cousin's brownies."
"Upon playing this game I truely beleived this game would satisfy my hunger for brutalising people... turns out however once the game is finished your victims are allowed to torment you for how badly you killed them... m8 u d3ad you out running no one and you cant scream for help anymore once i bust my fingers through your eyes or hang you up on a hook like salad fingers ( DLC IDEA!?!?!? ) i get talked how I camped a downed player or camping a hook... I want to watch them squeal... I am a killer its what I do... and you get called noob for that ? Weird... 11/ 10 would hang and scream wishing there was some form of ""all chat system"" so people could here my manic in me... also odd boner."
good survival game just need powerful pc
After 650+ Hours of gameplay im addicted usually games last to about 600hrs for me and i quit cause i get bored or something of that nature. I keep coming back to play more no matter what i do. New map's and new guns to new weapon mechanics im there baby! PUBG tho has been a rollercoaster of emotions and good updates and bad ones alike. So take it with a grain of salt when i say this is a great game because to each their own.
Good game for PVP and base building
It's good
This game is that DayZ should be. If you like games that are truely survival you will love this game.If you don't like running around you will not like this game
Good Game but Rockstar can you plz start fixing ur server problem and stop banning people for no reason?Almost 700Hours of playing GTAV but most of the time i stuck on the loading screen.I am sorry Rockstar for i don't have a SSD on my computer /
They're trying to kill off mods.And that's pretty Scummy.
Seems alright so far but it needs a story or something like missions. I would absoultely love this if it had space and ships to fly. *I recommend you only buy this game if you like exploration type games*
Best GTA so far
that game so big ! and so fun to play on !
Realistic gameplay and good graphcis. Thumbs up!!
ss
Easily the most fun and enertaining game I have ever played. I can't recommend this game enough. It's the only game I enjoyed enough to buy 3 copies of.
This game is good
didnt played too much but i always check updates and changes in stream. too many updates but it is still pubg as shroud said
Now I can play Tennis without people laughing at me. 10/10.
It sucks
Good Game )
still havent finish playing due to the witcher 3 but still gonna finish it .. realllly good game
Product received for free. Hello I'm a Chinese player. I was banned a week ago we Chinese quality is really low but not every Chinese cheating I didn't cheat just opened an uncommon VPN. You banned me I think this is a misunderstanding I hope steam team can help me unlock the game. If not please write to me why thank you! I'm not expecting a refund for your reply. Just want to find more contact way to let you contact me as soon as possible.
Nice game ! )
So the game is freaking phenomenal like the recipe they got going on here is f*cking GOLD. It's basically a straight to the point dayz standalone but you can go solo duo or squad of 4. It's highly addicting and fun even though myself and my friends aren't even really trying to get first place although i have gotten first place in solo duo and squad many times. Once you get past that point and you start to enjoy the game for what it realy is. PUBG is phenomenal because every time you jump out that plane..... PUBG is going to be a different experience everytime! One time i knocked out a squad of three guys in a house with just my fists i died two minutes later but i'll never forget it.So all these pansies talking about micro transactions hmmm ok well i don't think i will be buying any of those chests or keys or whatever since i don't care about cosmetics too much on this game. So many thumbs down because of that? if you were worried so much maybe you should get a job and pay for those transactions you can't afford? obviously it bothers you that much but no need for the thumbs down because of it. That is like me rating a product 1 star because the product came damaged because of shipping or whatever. Doesn't seem logical does it? All in all i take a break from arma 3 or league and play some pubg its quick and it's fun. Content i think comes out every month which is pretty decent. Game is stable now with maybe less then 1% of crashes occuring now.
Hot Wheels Soccer!!!!!!
Cancer game with cancer players and a cancer developer.wish i had my money back
Safe to say... BROKE but i still love this game for some reason
big moist
Never get bored in this game love those upcoming events
Just play Fortnite or wait for Dayz to be good again.
Product received for free. nice
Product received for free. In short vanilla Skyrim Legendary Edition with a lighting mod and a water mod. Textures are still bad can't change volume in game in fullscreen mode still capped at 60 fps by default and I still feel like there's a 50% chance alt tab will crash my game. The only redeeming quality is that it's 64 bit so mods have more room to work with.
buggy af
best game for the price like ballard of gay tony with better graphics
NEVER. TRUST. NAKED. MEN. EVER.
Played with friends and lost all 3 of them due to this game. 10/10
Supposed minimum requirement of RAM to play the game fine on low settings 6gbExpecteed amount of RAM needed to play the game 16 gb.
"Fun much fun with friendsA game like battle royale with squads or solo and mods ! xDThis game in game mic is pretty good having ""good communication"" with enemies everytime )A VERY GOOD COMMUNITY but still all i have to say is this game is AWESOME )PUBG &gt H1Z1"
Worst game anyone could possibly buy. you spend 9/10 of your time collecting stuff to see it get took down.
Great Game
Hey it's pretty good
Fix the crass bugs of the last update
Product received for free. Nothing to do no items spawning anywhere no objective no fun. Glad it was a gift.edit 11/1/2017 still nothing makes sense. no way to steady scope when aiming so you get shot from super far away meanwhile your scope swings all over the place for no reason even if you've been sitting still for five minutes.
nice
This game is great but was released in a broken state. Will update my review to positive once the online issues are resolved.
Product received for free. .......
Well this game was good wait thats a lie. Its only good with mods for offline use and now take two have banned the mods and taken open iv is down. This is the only reason many people by the game is just for the mods. Take your time and sign this petition. https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
Addiction like a indomie!
M I C R O T R A N S A C T I O N S
really nice
Product received for free. This game is so unfair cant win lol the killers can dash u go invis etc etc while u cant do jack br&gt and the servers are so laggy
A great game windows 98 runs perfect on this. 10/10 optimization.
So I recently went back to the Dead by Daylight page only to find I had left a negative review. And I have to say they have adressed nearly all of the issues I had with the game since then. Though the game isn't perfect most of its problems stem from the community which is much better than just having a broken game.There's not a whole lot of in game glitches. They happen from time to time but I haven't gotten stuck in a wall/hook since October of last year which is a major improvement from the game at the start. Also a system has been put in place to try to catch cheaters and to report people who engage in toxic behavior. THE DEVS ARE LISTENING!Though I question the pricepoints of the DLC packs I have to say that I'm impressed with how much the devs are pumping out good content for the game. Aside from the whole second chapter every single one of them has been of high quality (in fact they keep getting better). And on top of that the devs have stated that they are going to redo the entire swamp map and have buffed the hag since release to make her not entirely useless.I can't say how glad I am that I stuck with this game. Though I have to say if you do go to buy it be prepared for a somewhat toxic community. There are issues with the game like I said but again most of them come from the community. Though it sucks and I don't always have a good tiem with the game when I play it I don't think it's fair to fault the developers for it.Oh and the 1.5 update optimized the out of the game so that it actually runs well on my card even on bigger maps DOverall I give it like a 7/10. It's more fun when with friends but if you're looking for a grindy asymetrical MMO type game to sink your teeth into this is it!
Basically pay to do anything new as in spend 1000 hours grinding or buy money rock just wants dollar.
Very well made and lots of fun and very stressful. In early release so of course there are several bugs and glitches here and there but for the most part it plays really well.
its gta5. and u can mod it.
Pretty Gucci
One of the best GTA games.
This game is freeking awesome. Don't take my word it just plsu the thing.If you like games like Dayz Arma CSGO or battlefield you will like this game .
Best Horor multiplayer game I ever play. It is better than Friday the 13 . I want to see jason in dead by daylight is for me very powerful killer and I want to fix the Freedy Krugger. You must buy this game because is so fun to play with friends. Rate 10/10
Update 134New cupboard update ruined the game feedback will remain negative unless they fix it.Players can now place any twig structure in a building blocked zone.
Awesome and addictive. If you enjoy survival games this game has it all. Highly Recommended!
Astroneer is a terrifically fun game and I really hope the developer continues to produce quality updates for it. It has more content in it as a 'pre alpha' than a lot of early access and beta games that I've played in the past and it's ludicrously simple and fun.Yes there are some issues like crashing (primarily if you're playing multiplayer single player is very stable) and some wonky bugs like very rarely falling through the world when you get out of vehicles. And there's a finite amount of content in the game although there's enough IMO to justify its $20 price tag. There are also some basic features that you'll find in many games like a save management system that just aren't here.But the environments are gorgeous the play mechanics are intuitive and enjoyable (I especially like the fact that there's no UI it really helps with the immersion factor) and the graphics and animations are styilized but fun and beautiful. The fact that there are already multiple planets available (albeit with similar threats and resources available) is great for a game this early in its development.This honestly is what I think No Man's Sky intended to be on a smaller scale but with the potential to achieve what NMS probably won't. If you're into exploration/crafting/survival games I highly recommend picking it up to help out the developers to build this game into something amazing.
good game
Can someone my
Battleground is good graphic and everything is good.Crayon Shin
...
this game is a solid game but an unstable dumpster fire.everthing about his game oozes pation but passion doesn't mean it's a good game. it has so many small details but so many that they forgot to make the game playable.there are also aso many bussiness practices that they clearly trassitioned from a passion project to a money printer. they are no longer wanting to make a fun experience but want to milk this cow until it's nipples shoots blanks.I regret paying full price for this game. infact if I knew the condition of the game and wh the people making this game were would even hesitate for half off.
Product received for free. i love this game i love this game omg
boring af
1 ugrade your pc to nasa level2 play at 30fps3 figth with torches4 build your house like in minecraft5 watch bald men raid it6 enjoy bugs10/10 would get raided again
This game sometimes makes me want to punch the absolute crap out of my monitor while shoving my keyboard down my throat.The game is full of camping killers and idiots who constantly fail skill checks despite there being a noise right before the skill check.Also doctor don't play him or I will actually come to your house with my baseball bat wrapped with barbed wire and nails and beat you like Negan did Glenn in TWD
10/10
T'was good.....t'is now bad
Stop. Giving. Me. Locked. Crates. I loved the idea of you seperating locked and unlocked crates but now I've spent 5k BP trying to get a crate and every single one has been locked because you refuse to seperate locked and unlocked crates. it's t. I will not give you money for a stupid key. I PAID for this game. Give me an UNLOCKED crate and stop wasting all the BP I earned on these locked crates I have to pay to have opened. I DID NOT BUY A GAME just TO PAY MORE TO GET THINGS I EARNED.
awsome
it is quite fun tbh 9/10
This is my first review. Why? Because this game is that much fun! You should know! I play online multi player games exclusively like Overwatch Smite LoL Faeria Hearthstone Battlerite. But Rocket League is the easiest pick of all my games when I don't know which one to choose. I think I've had the most fun with Rocket League aswell. Sure when you get to Gold from silver standards there's Aerials all over the place and it's way more competitive. It can become frustrating if you play too much. But you'll always come back to it with a smile. Make sure you read atleast some other reviews here. This game is on a league of its own. It also helps there's way over 150 thousand people online huge tournaments ect. Unlike faeria which is the best card game but has like 250 people... 150 thousand means you'll always find people of your skill level. Easily!This game is like a sport on steroids. With all kinds of different tricks you can pull off with boost more boost! I'll only score the gameplay. 9.9/10 compared to todays standard. Have fun playing rocket league! Because you will!
This game was great at first! But then everything went downhill. This is basically csgo now. The crates wich was free at frist requeiers keys now wich is totally stupid. This game is great still but not as its earlier version. The option to choose maps would be great but its random. It kinda ruins the game. Anyways if you take everything that is problematic its actually more good(ness). I'll give PUBG a recomandation for now. We'll see if it improves over time or not.
One of a few games who actually made me addicted.
Great just Fing great i love this game!
ing battleye client doesn't work
Very well made and polished game for the most part. Only thing I can complain about is the terrible servers. You get shot around corners very consistently and it's not fun one bit.
One of the best games that i have played on my PC. I played it on Xbox first but the PC version is by far the best version of this fantastic game i could not recommend this more.
I AM FROM MALAYSIA!!! PLEASE FIX THE DISCONNECT ISSUE!!! ALWAYS GET DISCONNECT HALFWAY WHEN MULTIPLAYER KILLING BOSS!!!!!! PLEASE FIX IT ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Angry *aarghh*!
I can run around in my pants and for this reason I rate the game 10/10.
The game is a ton of fun. HOWEVER it's going in the wrong direction.Pay $20 &gt has cars as dlc &gt lootboxes keys you need to pay for &gt rocket pass locked behind grind &gt get a premium! Buy it.Haha for $20 you still don't get everything.
"This game is pretty neat as long as you have your lucky day and play with friends.This game is not so damn good if you keep having desync getting shot through ground getting camped like in CoD or getting random crashes.Unfortunately at least one of the former happens at least eight out of 10 games.Just wait for them to release a proper version and not follow the people who release ""beta"" game. What the is wrong with this industry and releasing unfinished products to the public."
Awesome. The physics make sense and graphics areGreat.
Many Many hours played (thumbs up!)
Love the game fun addicting and worth the money
L I T
I personally Find Rust be and amazing game with lots of content it can go 1 of a million ways u could start and with nothing and stay with nothing for hours then in a split second u could be full gear with Ak Metal Gear i personally think that the game is a great investment and if ur skeptical of buying wait for black Friday Christmas or any other holiday with 50% off sales and buy it then and u can always re fund if its not your cup of tea the game is definitely not for new PC gamer and its a brutal game to play but once u get past the starting stages of rust and know what your doing all it is fun and enjoyment ive met most of my good online friends over rust either from raiding them and then talking to them after or teaming up with them in a random server to raid some big zerg Rust was a big part of my life sadly i dont have a PC anymore but someday ill be able to pay again my personal time played is around 1250 Hours and ive been playing since XP days back when there was bugs and not to many players ive gotten to watch this game grow and deal with summer sale players and its been the best game i have ever played ever i recommend it if u like constant pvp and pushing your skill to the limit this game is 100% for u and just be happy new players u didnt have to deal with the old muzzle brake or heavy armour i also love the semi Automatic pistol (P2) no matter how much u want to Nerf it 10/10 Game
Rockstar Games who created this game is for the moment going nuts. Banning one after another. Due to all modders that exsists ingame. The modders walks free but innocent people gets flagged and banned right of! Get in contact with Rockstar is almost impossible. Its a sad but true story. Buy it for the Story version but be carefull online. Because a hacker or modder is waiting for you around the corner. And it's you who will get banned. Not the hacker! It's terrible but true.Otherwise it's an amazing game! Really loves it. But im one of these innocent people who can't play even tho i put up 59 99 for the game! Rockstar have made it impossible for me to play it for over a mounth now. And i've tryed to get in contact with em. But they don't really want to respond just telling me that il have to wait!ROCKSTAR SUPPORT SUCKS! But GTA V is an amazing game!
awesome game goooood!!!
Lots of people have been complaining about the game not working. I've had no issues of the sort here. Working fine! The only problem I've been facing is connection related same with my friends but it's the first weekend on PC so it's not a huge surprise the servers aren't doing that hot yet.The game itself is beautiful. The other Monster Hunter games I've played in the past were the 3DS ones so seeing the game on the big PC screen feels awesome. Hunting feels very exciting so far and I can't wait to find more interesting monsters to fight. It is a bit more cutscene heavy than the ones I've played prior which can be a negative point for some people but I dig it. Played for 4 hours so far and I'm having fun.
THIS GAME ING TRIGGERS ME
The LTS game modes are the best.
I have 400+ hours on the game now so I think I can write a decent review. This game will you off and make you laugh harder than ever before...I'd say atleast 60% of the game is just looting which I believe they need to increase as it can be very hard to come by. The rest is a mix between a walking sim and a shooter. Some people have been banned for no reason and that is not ok. I must also strongly recommend not playing squad games with random players. I have been teamkilled atleast a dozen times late game. This game will make you lose faith in humanity. 8/10
One day Lionel Messi bought mysterious shrooms from a street side seller and consumed them. After that he hijacked Nintendo and reinvented mariokart. Days later he somehow put up the game on steam. That's how rocket league is made. m8 I'd r8 8/8 Sincerely He Man
it is 100% a game
Everything except camper killers is fun. DHighly recommended to people who has friends.
lol
disgustingly clunky for a 2018 game
Can't jump over half walls or through windows 10/10 would be killed by blue zone again
i get more cancer smoking a pack of cigarettes than i do playing this trash game
100 players from the start Jumping out of a plane to any locaion you choose Finding gear and killing anyone who's not you or your fireteam. Holding down buildings from enemys or running across a open field and getting shot out of know where and hitting the deck and wondering what the hell to do. Great game and concept to the game. Fun if you have buddies. Also fun to team kill XD
I GOT THE CHICKEN DINNER!!
Better than H1NOFUNZ. Getting points to unlock cosmetics is a much better system instead of paying for crates and or paying to unock them. A great variety of weaponry and modes of fire along with several different attachments to fit your play style or current situation. Definetly worth playing and I'm excited to see how they will develope the game as time goes on.
10/10 I WOULD KILL NAKED WITH AN AK
PUB G is a lot of fun but still has quite a few bugs which can make it pretty frustrating at times.
Good job killing mods RIP GTA!
Best game so far!
Awesome but sucks cause it need more updates and fixes and I mean alot ... thanks
best open world online game
This game is a strange combination of grinding like in an RPG or MMORPG withg the cmaping ofRadiation Towns and gathering but it also has the survival aspect and building of Minecraft. It's a strange one but it works once you can get past the roadblocks of the settings and the spawnkilling in certain servers it's a ton of fun with a group of friends.Also if you have the machine to run it the grass effects and the Sun/Moon lighting make it quite thbegame to look at even in the alpha.
A game with numerous faults but also plenty of potential.
Pretty good
Very good 10/12
This game is very fun and enjoyable but at the same time extremely frustrating and to be able to enjoy it you need to put the hours in and give it a chance. I highly recommend getting this game because the people who work on the game care about it and dont just leave it to die *cough cough valve*
Still love this game after all the hours I have put into it.
it plays on my laptop with litle lag and not problem in aking my memory space grate new features .worth the price not regrets .why rockstar gta 4 lags and this dont ?i see why coz is similar to console new features .
What a good game this is balanced and fun playing with 300fps and no lag at all. Severs are working perfectly too. 10/10 need to cost more than 100e
Cars r fun xD
Great game lot of fun in it
It's a great game and I think it's best multiplayer game ever. It's fun and tiring. If you want a slow game you go to a lowly populated area and go to a populated one to have a more intense game. It's great but just have a strong enough computer to play it.
"I first bought this game and went to a random server with a few of my friendslittle did i know that server had one crazy korean man on it set on killing everyone of course my friends soon wanted to leavejust then a magical being swooped in from the heavens saying ""DON'T LEAVE!!"" My friends lefti stayed i built a home across the field from this magical being he tried to help me break down my own door he gave me woodhe was god 10/10 would play again"
cute
Love this game haven't had any crashing issues. Only connection issues but works enough of the time.
Well.. I figured I would finally review this game. It can be so fun and frustrating at the same time... I know this is only early acess but I really hope the optimizing anti cheat is high up on the list of priority of the devs. In my humble opinion for a Early Access I give it...7/10
horrible optimizationcan't customize character not even change freaking gender because devs are feminists or some greatwould refund if i could
Dead Game bug everywher and CHEATING RegionLockChina
Great game I got it two days ago and I've been playing it nonstop. I understand thay it's noteveryoes cup of tea but if you love driving at fast speeds with wonky physics trying to hit a gigantic soccerball than this game isfor you.
The most toxic community ever to gather in one place.I forgot that nice people even exist.10/10
very nice game detailed and does not lag at all
Every campers dream game. Anyone that cant play shooters this is the game for you.
Absolutely worth every penny of the $29.99 pricetag. I have a GTX 1070 and it runs well over 60 FPS at max settings with very few frame drops. I am very pleased with this purchase.
This game is so good if you can run it but some gamemodes can be pretty like tiny racers but I would HIGHLY sugest this game.
Probably one of my favorite games on steam.Not the most friendly game but gather a group of friends and you''ll be good to go on the journey to the late game.
idk im running on very low 720p but still laging af i played other 2017 games and can run in high very high 1080p and get 60fps this game basically need a massive fix
"This game is one of the most fun games I've played in a long time. Solo is fun but playing Duo (with one other friend) and Squads (with two or more friends) is the best. Had issues at the start with a ""Network Lag Detected"" error where it kicked me from games and would take a few minutes to rejoin However once I fixed this issue the game has been a blast. Yeah you'll die a lot. You probably won't get a chicken dinner on your first run but for some reason I still enjoy spawning looting killing and dying over and over again. For an early access game this is fantastic! Now let's just hope the developers actually push it out of early access unlike most games."
"Heya All I am very happy for this update. I have played with Vanilla Skyrim SE and like what I see so far. However I am tabling it for now until some mods I like get converted. I beat skyrim on an un modded playthru during origional release. So I got that feel already. These days I prefer the modded experiance for some aspects of my play thru.SE Pros Updated Base World Graphics Asthetics and ENB (lighting). Seems to be nicer and more true to Bethesda fantasy but with better graphics. So possibly may not need as many visual mods. Played for a short while looked at many world textures and I personally am happy. Engine Converted to 64 Bit allowing game and some mods to function better on current PCs. This paves the way for potentially new mods that can do much more than before. Thats up to the creativeness of the community though.SE Cons ""Unofficial Skyrim Patch"" was not integrated into the base game to my knowledge. I do not know if Bethesda performed any offical bug fixes to the base game or not. But my hunch is we will still need the ""Unofficial Skyrim Patch"" to fix alot of things in the world. Some players have tried the patch on Skyrim SE but it seems to cause problems. So we need to wait for the mod to be updated to work better with Skyrim SE. Old textures on Armors weapons equipment house hold objects dungeon objects and thousands of other items don't look updated to me. Looking forward to the Static Mesh improvement mod HD weapon/Armor mods to be converted to Skyrim SE. Not looking for non skyrim items/equipment meshes. Just would like higher quality meshes for existing skyrim equipment. Kinda the bridge between lore friendly and better looking. Not older PC friendly. If you ran Skyrim on High/Ultra 5 6 years ago you might be at low/Medium settings today with Skyrim SE. If you've updated your computer since then like I did. You might still be at High/Ultra. No NPC or Character mesh/skin updates. Still have origional character looks/feels. Will need modding to touch up some people. Waiting for CBBE to be converted... Don't judge me... &gt .&gt Many older Mods may never work again unless the Mod Author comes back to update it or another mod author takes over the project and tries to update it.Other Notes PC Performance. Some users are reporting sinificant performance issues with their computers. When they list their system specs and I compare it to mine sometimes we're fairly similar. Yet I am not noticing any visual or perfomance issues. My rig is a Win 10 PRO i7 6700k 32GB ram GeForce GTX 970 and Samsung Evo 850 SSDs. Some users are reporting Bugs with the starting scene on the cart. No mods yet the cart still flips the fraq out or the Horses get in the way during the execution scene. Hopefully a bugfix will come for that soon. Mod Development will take time folks. Its up to you to decide if you want to play a limited mod experiance or wait for a while. thank you all and I hope you enjoy the updates and updated mods. Good luck Mod Makers. Im rooting for you."
I've been playing GTA V since it first came out and I have had a lot of fun with it. It's definitely more fun to play with friends but it can still be fun to play by yourself.
very fun but colors are dull i know this a dark game but still
Poorly maintained servers experiencing constant network lags
I like
Killed a deer got chicken meat out of it 5/7 would recommend.
Number 1
nice game
NEEDS A MAP SELECT OPTION!
I'm having an issue with this game. First time i started it it worked perfectly fine but then i got back in another game. Later on i wanted to play again but the game just does not load... It freezes in the menu or the black copyright screen. The game is fun though.. The problem is that i cant play D hopefully fixing this devs. I think my compter can handle the game. I ticked that i recommend this game but it's in between recommend and not recommend for me.
10/10 for naked bashing
"This game is complete trash. Honestly I'm still wondering how the they actually thought this game was ""ready"" when it was ""offically"" released back in Dec 21 2017 with the 1.0 update. They are some scumbags honestly. Game keeps crashing frequently and it hasn't been all this way when I first brought the game back in March I believe. Now whenever I load into the game it takes forever and by the time it does load I'm at the end of the plane route whereas my teammates have already jump in some other area that I am half across the map from. Ever since the recent updates I feel like with every ""patch"" or update the game continues to progress in a poorly optimized setting for their game and it's really sad. The game has almost been fully released in almost a year now and it's still this ""Fix PUBG"" is a joke as of right now the recent ""fixes"" they put out only gets worse and worse for me. I really hope by the time they finshed with all the fixes they promised us in their Fixed PUBG website is true and they would continue to patch this game up but as of right now don't but this game until they fixed all the damn bugs desync and optimized this damn game. I only play this game because I have hope that this game could be the best it can be in the spam of 3 months of fixes from the devs."
Of course you should buy this game. It's Grand Theft Auto and it does what you want it to do. Singleplayer is just as fun as online play with a great story. Just a no brainer.***EDIT PLEASE RECONSIDER THIS REVIEW.***I was one of the multiple people banned after minimal gameplay time and absolutely no history of cheating. Don't buy this game. If a company is going to be so careless in how they handle their playerbase you should not invest 60 dollars in them. I have sent multiple tickets to support to see if i can get at the very least an EXPLANATION why I got banned but the only person that has bothered to respond was ING TREVOR. TREVOR. FROM STORY MODE. Don't waste your money. You'll just be banned.
This game is a great game. As many online games there are toxic people and there are people who arent great at the game. Dont let the toxicity ruin the game. It is very fun. There are some bugs but they fix them fairly quick. The devs are doing their best and thats what matters.
I reccomend this game to anyone who likes Minecraft DayZ 7D2D Nether or any game that involves surviving and building. There are currently lag issues here and there and some glitches when buiding. But it does give you a feel of being alone. Join friends....makes life better.
Can play this game for hours and hours without advancing the storyline. Just roaming around doing random things driving the car and side missions is entertaining in itself.
10/10 would miss that ball again.
Rough on the edges but seriously addicting.
I made a P0rnhub Sign...I posted it on my steam...Overall 69/10
"For those who have played ARK the style of gameplay is very similar.Collect items from the world around you build tools to colelct from new sources/more efficiently and don't let the vicious animals see you or they will eat your face. In Rust however there is no character creation. You all spawn as a big naked dude. Thank goodness for the pixelation or else I would have had a LOT of explaining to do to my mother.It is quite difficult to figure out what you are doing in this game especially on a server. I reccomend either finding an empty server or starting one in order to get used to what is going on. Early game it's easiest to hang around the towns where you can readily find blueprints water food and items.Right click is usually ""throw"" avoid clicking this unless you want to fling your items into the bushes to be lost forever.As far as finding your friends navigating the map is rather hard. My suggestion would be to either find a rad town and follow the road/powerlines until you locate one another or to have one person set up a quick base with a sleeping bag for the other person to spawn in.Starting as a new player on a server with established clans isn't going to work. You are going to be killed repeatedly it's going to be frustrating and you're never going to get to actually play the game. PVE servers are great for learning and the people there are usually very willing to help you along just pay attention to the rules.Helicopters are evil. If you hear a helicopter RUN. You cannot win againt this thing without some serious firepower. Hide somewhere with a decent roof and away from open windows/doors.Watch the sound levels especially when first logging on. If you think the footsteps are loud? Wait till someone sets off a shotgun near your head. I about jumped out of my skin.There are a few serious glitches in the game but nothing that absolutely breaks it. Be warned bear traps do NOT in fact work on bears. Doors can be glitched through under the right circumstances and occasionally the naked people who logged off will float above the ground for no apparent reason.Overall this is a fun game but seems to be one where you can upgrade everything to a point and then have nothing left to do. This is solved on PVP servers by having others around to attack/be attacked by however it leaves little to do for those on less populated or PVE servers. Hopefully there will be more updates for the game as I am greatly enjoying it so far and hope to continue."
Take two ineractive. them right in the god damn
Good game still has some lag issues now and again.
good gaem
need improvemnts and game is awesome
A great game it is addictive and you can have a great time with it. The developers really wants you to play once a day. Other people raid you unless you have a very secure base. If you are not in the server for a while your base will decay which basically means that it will disappear it's good and bad because it saves server performance but it also forces you to play once everyday basically.The game suffers from hacking and glitching at the moment but we all know that this is an early alpha and we are a part of the process. The developers knows what they are doing so my faith in them is full. If you have alot of spare time in your life and feel that this will be a good game for you then go for it i totally recommend it. Please don't mix this game with dayz.. It's the same genre as dayz but the community is completely different. People will shoot you all the time and saying that you are friendly doesn't work often. I'm saying this because most people whine about getting shot all the time. My point of the game is just take it or leave it! And please.. don't play alone because you are most likely going to have a bad time. It's a teamplay game and surviving solo is very hard!So to summarize i recommend this game. If you have some time to kill do it with this game!
This truly is an amazing game. The graphics are absolutely stunning and the mechanics are so well thought out and made. I have around 61 hours on the game but I've only had it for about a month and can only play on weekends. The community isn't as toxic as most people say. I have logged on to multiple servers as a naked and was given a base and multiple full gear sets. Some people are rude but I believe that that's the entire purpose of the game. It was made so people could survive and fight and not so everyone could sit around and gather resources. It just came out of early access and I know that the only place this game can go is straight to the top. Highly reccomend it. 9.5/10
"I've been playing since Alpha Extremely fun but challenging game. This is the first game I bought on STEAM and I haven't gotten tired of it. It's an instant classic for survival games honestly in a league of it's own. I've also had the fortune to meet some amazing online friends to play with. But as in any game I have also had the misfortune to meet some less than reputable people. This game is only in it's beginning stages but it is not for the faint of heart. You will die you will get set back but eventually after spending enough time learning to play and investing yourself in the game. You will begin to find your nitch and that moment is when this game really becomes enjoyable. The world map looks small but it couldn't be any bigger with day and night cycles you will actually measure distance in ""Days"" and begin to say things like ""It will take me (x amount) of days"" to get to there"" or ""We will head out in the morning"". I would suggest this game to anyone and everyone who likes survival games and a challenge. I don't want to use a rating scale because everyone is promised to have a different experience. My personal one I'm hooked and I wouldn't have it any other way. It is an individualistic experience that can't be explained in words. It is worth the money you pay for it even through your frustration of dying or being ""robbed"" you will still want to play."

Great gameplay but server too terrible problem and issue keep happen time and time.Why BH does not upgrade their server to handle 20 mil player?
I definitely recommend this game to all the people that are interested in MMO survival sandbox pvp game. Servers range from low 50 to high 200 capacity. Usually you trust no one as a starter but having a trustworthy team later on can greatly improve your gaming experiences. Full loots weapons range from rock (your best friend) to OP guns. This game is still in alpha but game look and feel fluid and clean. There are monthly updates that add more and more features...Overall game is worth the bucks!Why are you still reading this? PLAY THE GAME!
Way too many cheaters in this game. Review is going negative until anti cheat is fixed. Don't bother picking this up until they fix that.The Chinese players playing on non Asian servers are ruining the game.
It's okaybetter than fifa 15
Okay so this game is extremely fantastic and gets your heart pumping. HOWEVER once you get to high ranks the number of hackers is so terrible. There is a hacker in everygame and now you can even see it in the deathcam. I have had multiple times where someone would be scoped in on the ground and then snap to my head then killing me ruining my duos and solos. Not to mention I have qued into duos and squad and have gotten 2 people that spoke english in my whole time playing PUBG. Sometimes you will have lag and hit reg problems but those problems seem to be dwarfed by the hackers/cheaters. I want to love this game and I do love it but I can't recommend this game until they fix the major problem which imo is the cheaters. Only then can they start to fix the hit reg and lag issues that are present.

Updated Review Game performance has improved both textures and CPU usage. Some area still CPU bottleneck. Connectivity issues have been resolved and random crashes as well. This is a really fun game and now with the additional content will be better. Original Review This game should've stayed a little more time in the oven even more when half of it's issues were present during the console launch.Please do the following Capcom * Remove DRM. It's hogging down CPU performance.* Fix the connectivity issues* Please provide better quality textures.* Please streamline and improve the connection loss and implement a re host/regroup option.* Allow to create an online session from inside a mission. Thanks to the current connectivity errors I have to either finish/abandon a quest so my friends and I can rejoin.To the gamer This game is amazing however there are a lot of problems with it if you're looking into playing co op. Otherwise it's good. Solo is fine until the high ranked bosses. Either grind or wait for a friend patch.
this game is a buggy piece of garbage certainly do not buy it
Wow! Didn't thought this game will be so much fun! Especially playing with friends and using controller! )
Look Promising
1.5 million for purchasing early is a lie..allow me to clarify if you want the FULL amount.it is a lie..you cannot get 1 million of it unless you PVP!!!!!...PVErs were only given 500k!!!!!....this is a total misrepresentation of what was to be when sold ...if developers/reps will lie this early then game isnt worth it
"I have a low amount of hours on this game but i don't think anyone should waste their hard earned TRAPPP money on this game. The servers are unreliable and the dev team isn't doing their job by optomizing the game. i have a GTX 1070 with 32 gigs of ram an SSD and a hyperthreaded 4 core processor. and this game still crashes.When a game making as much money as it does selling this game to 15 year olds trying to play with their friends they should really be looking to update their game before creating an e sports scene. The version of the game they use in the tournements are not the same as they are on the lvie game. I don't think a company the ""plays"" their players like that shouldn't be in business and certainly does not deserve your business."

Doors are almost as unresponsive as in DayZ.10/10
Don't buy this trash game it used to be fun but they literally never made the game any better it's still flawed and now they spam you with ads to buy skins and other garbage. The game had potential but it was ruined.
10/10recoginzes that China is #1
This game can be quite fun however the fact remains that it is very survivor tailored. Being a killer is like trying to open the worlds toughest pickle jar with your toes. This new ranking system makes pipping incredibly hard for killers as it really hurts you in ways you really can't control. In fact it seems to reward you for camping a survivor which is not fun for either party. It is also worth noting that bugs are incredibly common and rarely fixed. When they are they've been in the game for quite awhile. I rather like this game but it's honestly not worth the time nor the money I invested in it. It's rather sad.
"Fun game but the introduction of paid keys for ""Desperado"" is a step in the wrong direction"
This game is garbage poorly optimized plenty of cheaters extremly RNG HOWEVER it is a very addictive gameBluehole is following the path of Daybreak H1Z1 No RNG btw haHAA

A stunning value in a well made sparkler Rocket League promises subtle hints of exhaust extra effervescence when first poured and a crisp finish. Consider it with smoked salmon all manner of seafood cream based soups and soft and semisoft cheeses.

Started playing Rocket League after being recommended to me by a friend on launch day 2015. Since then I've moved from PS4 to steam. This game has the best fun per dollar ratio ever. Updates are free and occur regularly gameplay is fun quick and addictive. Five minute sessions are long enough to feel complete and quick enough to hook you into an all nighter playing over and over. Ths game is my go to when I want to relax or play competitively. Very much worth the purchase for you or a friend. People who care about people tell other people about Rocket League
ING TIRED OF BEING KNOCKED OFF THE TRACK DURING RACES
挂多 而且问题多 老是网络检测延迟 整队人都是这样的情况 估计整个游戏里的人都这样 从昨天到今天一直遇到这样的问题 重连还连不上 搜了几十分钟 刚打倒几队 进入了决赛圈 突然就说网络检测延迟 你MB真的火大 好几次这样 你他吗反挂没能力就算了 连做好一个游戏的能力都没有 么 太尼玛的失望了 我要求给老子退款 蓝洞 烂洞

One of the best games out there right now. I have spent around 80 hours just in 1 week because i am so hooked. At first the game is very hard and you lose every firefight but after around 20 30 hours u start understanding and getting good. Playing with friends is the most fun thing to do duo or Squad.If you dont have any friends with this game that's fine! Jump into squad game and in time people will ask for your steam account and you will get new friends. So far i have not experienced any major glitches not even minor ones. I have only meet one hacker so far in 250 games so i don't see why people complain. Overall it's very fun game if you enjoy games as DayZ or arma III you will enjoy this )
Grand Theift Auto 5 is literally one of my favourite games when I want to kick back relax and blow stuff up. I have spent most of my time playing this using their online feature and it's great. They constantly update it making it better than before. This game has really come a long way and I do recommend it to people who like free roaming chaos.

Glitchy asf and horrible gameplay. Had high hopes but the producers just destroyed the game. well done idiots

E' impossibile giocare survival dopo l'ultimo aggiornamento infatti giocano tutti killer e si aspetta talmente tanto tempo di entrare in una lobby che è diventato lobby simulator. Non consigliato fino a nuovo update o rolling back.I perk e la botola devono devono assolutamente essere nerfati.La mancanza di server dedicati crea dei lag inconcepibili per un gioco real time e molti giocatori sono vittime di attacchi ddosIt is impossible to play survival after the last update in fact they all play killer and expect so much time to enter a lobby that has become a lobby simulator. Not recommended until new update or rolling back.The perks and the hatch must absolutely be nerf.The lack of dedicated servers creates unimaginable lag for a real time game and many players are VIKTIMS OF DDOS ATTACKS
Great game i can see a future to this game.
Highly suggest you dont play this game because of all of the blantant cheaters

Product received for free. Upgraded version of one of my top games.
A great game if you want to relax for a minute and play without any stress.Short gameplay time for each match makes it the perfect game for casual gaming.
Please PLEASE fix your game the level of bugs that are in this game are crazy. BS headshots shots that dont register its crazy. The level of frame loss is crazy aswel. I like the game I just hate losing gun fights for BS reasons. the gun fights (which are pretty important in this game) is I swear I'm shooting more that half the people in the head but get headshotted myself. PLEASE FIX IT. As for now my recomendation stands as a NO. I'll keep playing the game only because there's nothing else to play.
In my opinion if you love the racing games and jumps and all other stuff. Rocket League will definately help you in this situation
pretty ing boring and the developer is a
G00d game either for free play or Misson
Well thats 179 hours of my life and 4 of my friends that I will never see again.
Excellent entry to the Monster Hunter series. Has a few technical issues but gameplay is so good I've taken to calling it Quality of Life Hunter.Pros +Its monster hunter that means boss fights to turn dinosaurs into armor and weapons to fight bigger dinosaurs+excellent combat system+Graphics are great if your rig can handle it+plethora of graphics options if you can't+many QoL items that were a drag for previous installments have been eliminated or streamlined+fun and varied monster fights+EXCELLENT Environments with interactables and destructables galore+they will be adding more monsters (look at what consoles got for an idea theres no official roadmap)Cons very system resource intensive. AMD systems got a better run of it especially since the newest Nvidia drivers dont play nice. Story is lackluster (but who cares thats not why you buy a monster hunter game) Constant connection issues with multiplayer (although there is talk of patching this it does get annoying) no native steam controller support but it works fine for xbox configs relatively small monster list compared to other MH games (30 something vs 90 something from 4u and gen but who knows maybe theyll add that many)
Story Mode A beautiful mastery in game design awesome visuals characters and plot.Online Get Mangled by a 12 year old with 18 Billion Dollars.11/10
Really great game and i've had a great time playing it )
Solos are intense duos are enjoyable i like this game a lot.
I was looking forward to this game coming to pc and when its release was delayed to make sure it was perfect I was impressed with the choice the final product is terrible and extremely disappointing. It glitches controls are slow too many server errors for the time I have played. Though it does look great for a game I anticipated so much I am highly disappointed especially after the delay in release so it could be perfected.
wow much fun
Just awesome.
I get stuck at the waiting for character screen (
This is a interesting game al tought the servers are colapse some times and causes have to play on far away severs. Also can be good new maps weaponsm and vehicules to upgrade the experience of the game.
ALWAYS REMEMBER OUR SAVIOR OPEN IV
This game is one of the best games i ever played.
Fast flying cars 10/10 cocket league. faster than my dad chasing me trying to beat me
the game keeps crashing fix the bug please
"In the beginning way back in the closed beta I played PUBG.""Promising "" I thought to myself and a while later the beta closed. I waited and waited and the game finally released. I got my 30 bucks and I bought it. I joined my first match excited to see how awesome it had become. The only problem? It was crap.I uninstalled then waited until yesterday when I started playing again to check out if it had gotten better.Now it's actually fantastic! I had *fun* playing this game unlike ever before! Now I mean I have had negative interactions with moderators back on the beta forums but they seem to have gotten less horrible. I would definitely recommend this."
I hate gta5 now my social club account never will load up now I need help. i can sign in however but I cannot get it to load it is on a forever loading screen
Best game I ever bought in 2016! Should have done it earlier!
Mr X is too scary. bad game design
keci jó volt 60 ért kösz helo
Good game
I'm just gonna go ahead and say that the game is great.The recent update on September 6th has solved the remainder of the connection issues that although didn't happen to me personally did plague many others. It also fixed the frame drops that occured during high intensity moments of Kushala or Teostra. With Deviljho being released and much more content to be available in the coming monthes I don't see why you shouldn't pick this game up.Don't bother with the mixed rating just a lot of babies who aren't updating their reviews along with Capcom's fixes. What I commonly see as reasons would be the 6 months wait and how they shouldn't of released the game if it wasn't finished yet. To be honest the released version of the game wasn't that bad. The hunts were fun and I'd much rather have access to the game as early as possible. I'm sure many others were excited and couldn't wait any longer as well.
PLAYER UNKNOWNS CHINESE CHEATING BATTLEGROUND. REGION LOCK THE CHINESE SERVERS THESE POS HAVE RUINED THE GAME WITH THEIR HACKS AND INFESTATION OF THE OCEANIC EUROPEAN NA SERVERS.. STILL APRIL 2018 AND JUST CONSTANT CHEATING. ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC. CANT PLAY ON A SERVER IN ANY GROUP WITHOUT IT BEING FULL OF CHINESE WHO CANT SPEAK ENGLISH AND WHO PLAY THE GAME WITH OPEN MIC AND MECHANICAL KEYBOARD. I HAVE 550 hours on this GAME DO NOT PLAY IT OR BUY IT!
It's a fun game ive got 700 hours on this.. just for 27 pounds its a bargin and addictive.
car soccer.with rockets.
There is plenty of good reviews about this game.I enjoy it mostly the ICE rink mod. wish that was the main game as i find the ball touch too random for my taste.what i really hate about the game is matchmaking and joining games with 1 minute to go loosing 6 nul.just fix that all ready.
Product received for free. Really good game i would rate 11 10 best game i have played so far
the new updating has caused a serious bug which turns every words in to dots. and I am enable to read any of the context now. this is very annoying wish can have a instant update to solve this bug
Games looks good i have put few hours on it but its basicaly UNPLAYBLE due every 2 minutes diconnections after 5 days of launch just today they recognized the issue.Bad company Dont buy it if you plan to play coop.
Awesome game if you can get this during a sale don't even hesitate!
"Game is broken and buggy as hell. Got stuck between some rocks had to wait until my hunger and then health went all the way down until I could die and get out took about 20 minutes. The game has a ""Sleeper"" system which basically means that whenever you log off your body falls to the ground asleep and you then get robbed and killed when you are away so if you want to progress you can't log off. Early shelters are easily broken into so all your progress can and will be reset if you aren't willing to sink 4 hours of just farming materials when you start up to get a decent house. Unfortunately even higher quality homes are easily broken into due to the easy availability of C4. Expect to lose everything and have to restart often it's fun for a bit then it just gets old. Game encourages bullying of newer players expect to be shot by more experience players for fun regularly. Players are actively malicious and often attempt to trap you in cells so that you can only get out by starving and wasting 20 minutes of your time. Horrible playerbase poorly thought out mechanics. Do not get."
Horrible game devs
Horrible optimization hit reg and developers. Thrilling at times but more often frustrating. Stay away.Cons Incredibly clunky movement and combatTerrible hit registration and optimizationInteriors are ugly and full of low res texturesYou won't be put into a game when you're alt tabbed. If you're in a squad it'll put them in without you.Terrible developers. Banning people for stream sniping threatening legal action against Fortnite Battle Royale putting ads in the main menu on Chinese servers and lying about not putting in microtransactions during Early Access.Pros Driving is fun. Nothing like flying off a hill and butchering the landingPlenty of opportunities for shenanigans with friendsGetting your first coveted chicken dinner is a great feeling
nice game. very interesting
gta 5 is an amazing game we should all know this.but the real question is if its a good port(its not realy a port but still)the answer is yes aside from a few bugs i have ran in to like the humorous line glitch for characters online to frustrating glitch were i freeze durring heistsbut all my concerns can be patched out so i would recommend )
"A game with easy to understand concept and very high skill ceiling. ""Just one more game"" is a phrase uttered many a time with this one. 10/10"
Garbage games there are too many players
Great game addictive just remember to have fun (and you will) while getting to know the physics and controls. Can be frustrating at times. Still trying (and failing) like hell to fly and score an aerial goal. I highly recommend to play it with friends.10/10
Its good

Best. Game. Ever. PERIOD&gt shjit that wasssn't a period?
This ia an awesome game where you basically put together the idea of soccer matches and undestroyable cars! Great game and really like itOne thing I would like to add is where people are more balanced like where pros are playing with Pros because MANY times I have lost a game due to a bad teammate!*November 2018 Update* I don't like the idea of the rocket pass because it is DEFINITLY copying Fortnite (not like that is a good game). Many devs have copied the idea of a Battle Royale and now Rocket league is too. This was such a fun game to play with before the rocket pass
The game is great! Still alot of things to work out but its understandable. Would love a few more maps ones that are smaller so there is the option of quicker rounds.
Pro Wastes timeCon looking on any settingCancer communityNo real updates (they just add new biomes and new BS)Game is no fun unless you have someone to play withWaste of time

Insanely fast paced and fun team based gameplay. The only thing I am missing is half naked girls on the cars10/10 this game will be a good source of entertainment for long to come
You spawn you see another naked you try to talk to them you get a rock hurled at your head.0/10 this game lost the social aspect which made it fun.
То что сейчас делают разработчики с этой играй просто калл!!! Добавление системы чертежей и из за них развитие идёт к нулю. Я эту игру окупил но не рад что сней сделали(((
sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo nic so good so butfel game
The game is very poorly optimized &amp not fun due to campers everywhere.Got stale after 5 matches.
I got the famous ERR12 Graphics Device Crashed error. The game woudn't even start.Spent about an hour reading posts about it to decide what to do.I eventually rolled back my Nvidia drivers to ver. 319.35 and the game finally worked. It looks like a fun game and I'm just starting to play it but it seems really poorly ported. If I have to keep my drivers like this forever I'll be pretty upset.
games a joke and has no future
Good game but my character's is too small ( !
F*ckin' A! nuff said
Games fail to load half the time with players stuck in resserved.
This is a pretty simple game to play it correctly do as follows1 Get in discord with your friends at 3pm on a Friday just after school is over2 Spend 12 hours grinding for wood stone and any pieces of equipment you find in barrels3 Fend off armed players with a stone for the next 3 hours (spear optional if you're that advanced4 Build a hideous little cabin in the mountains that you'll call home for the night. Anywhere else is prone to being raided5 Fight off the freezing temperatures with shoes and a bandana and ration expired watermelon with your party until morning6 Wake up realize a few players somehow destroyed your african cloth walls overnight and took all of your belongings7 Go outside to try and find them take an arrow to the skull and bleed out while a naked black man incoherently laughs while crouching over your body8 Lose all progress when server restarts the next dayOverall 9/10 experience. Would recommend to anyone who has 20 30 hours to waste
Rockstar is anti modding there is nothing more to say. Why the would you be this anti modding? They are banning people for using a FOV fix since the FOV is locked to max 75 which is unplayed. And they are banning people for using Mods in Single Player. move Rockstar.
Is this game e sport ready ? No It's a joke.Laggy servers piece of hitbox and cheaters with macro... This is the game in a nutshell.
fun shoots.
RUSTIt has so many layers to it so where to begin.Well. I'm no writer so I'll try to keep it to the point.Typical negative stuff said about RUST Hackers haven't ever seen one. 587 hrs on record. Grind Sure. But there are tons of servers with x3/x5/x10 even x1000. You think it feel like a grind simply pick another server. Griefers Once again. Pick the right server with no griefs allowed. Griefed anyways pop a quick message to admin and they'll help you. If not then you're doubtfully on the right server. Lag Not really not anymore than the next game even though there has been some at late I haven't really noticed any since 2 updates ago. Only people who shoot on sight Simply not true. Alliances are made and RUST has somewhat of a self justice enviroment. Especially if you like to be part of the social aspect chat helping people ect. It's my clear opinion that jackasses often get's as deserved. It really is a living social world where you'll meet the same people many times which is why you'll know who's who form alliences build neighborhoods ect. If you are a lone wolf like playing solo well unless you're one of those Chuck Norris kind of guys unlearn that quick to survive ) Offline raiders Build better bases it's a big part of why I enjoy RUST. Trial and error baby learn from your mistakes. There is alot of different ways to keep those unwanted visitors out and I personally love to see how raiders have to give up. I don't understand why people get so upset over raiders. They are doing you a service by testing out your design... for free and they use plenty of ressources to do it. Unless ofc they find your lootroom..What else.. What do I don't like?All of above still jazz
I really hate to give this game a bad rep based on something not game related but I feel compelled to warn those thinking of purchasing and losing $60.00. I bought this game after it came out for PC as an upgrade from my PS3 version. Graphics are crisp and beautiful the story is excellent with tons of extras after you finish the main storyline. My problem is with the Rockstar Social Club and their TERRIBLE service. They will not respond to countless emails I have sent to them about how their Social Club launcher will not let me play my game if this was one of the cheaper less new games I probably would not be so passionate about this but for this I feel completely jipped and ripped off. My experience with Rockstar has been one with months of not being able to play the game I spent a lot of money on and after this awful experience I will more than likely be searching for other games to spend my little amount of time one. Social Club is complete garbage and I'm shocked that such a well respected company treats their customers in this manner. Will more than likely not be purchasing another Rockstar product that I cannot even play.

The amount of angry entitled losers who keep tanking the games rating is a sorry example of the state of gaming today. You'd think the developers had publicly killed a puppy the way people are reacting instead of adding purely optional and purely cosmetic micro transactions. The game is fun zany and due to the amount of players and the way that it's structured you never know what's going to happen. I highly recommend this game. The new first person servers are definetly my favourite though. Third person too strongly favours camping.
New hunter or old hunter please give it a try. I started MH series with PSP then with 2DS. One thing i need to sat about MHW is that i can finally play on my PC.
Great gamme 10/10
connection issue still hasnt fixed yet
"It's regular ol' skyrim just with more realisitc lighting. That's it. No new content no enhanced meshes or textures no fixes to cruddy npc AI or anything of the sort. If you already have vanilla skyrim there is NO reason to spend money on this. I already had the full set so I got it for free but I would never even consider ""upgrading"" otherwise. You can get a much better experience with regular skyrim just by adding a few choice mods. I really don't know why bethesda even made this a thing. They could've just made a lighting patch for the original. Seriously why does this exist?!"
Updated for post release There's a reason devs are ripping off this game. The formula is solid. Sure there's going to be new twists on this style of game and improvements but PUBG is solid in it's simple design. It's not a game that demands huge amounts of your time but if you chose to dedicate yourself it'd pay off.Its great to load up when you have an hour or so to spare and it's great for an evening of gaming with friends too. Even if you aren't good or experienced with FPS or battle royale styles of games it's fun.The replays are a lot of fun to watch back and include the ability to spectate who else was near by and what was happening around you during past matches which could be really useful to someone trying to git gud or for someone like me is just fun to see how wrong things could or did go.There are issues sometimes with rubber banding and I think there's small improvements to be made to just the over all polish but having seen it grow through development I have faith in the devs that these things will be sorted. I'd say this is a must buy for anyone who has ever played and enjoyed FPS games.
Very good for YT videos especially Story mode mods!

Worst game i ever pl ayed
Just not a friendly specs game for mid end PC user like me. Please make more comforable in 4GB users.
1. Land in big city2. Grab weapon3. Put energy drink as a bait in building4. Camp for players to grab it5. Kill him6. Profit
Everything what Rockstar wants is money unfortunately. And they recently shut down OpenIV so... Really bad approach for so big company.
The gameplay felt old and rusty
Feel like this is to early to write a review but the 9 hours I have played it have been amazing and I feel comfortable writing one. First off if you don't have this game go ahead and get it because I'm just going to be writing about how amazing it is and you'll waste your time so just get it. Now Rocket League despite what a lot of people are saying this game is not fifa with cars in any way. This game is its own game there is no passing period. If you expect everyone to be in order and stick to actual soccer positions you will unterly fail because this game is chaos and the object is to get the ball into the other teams goal and keep the ball out of yours. There really is no teamwork but if you want to succeed you have to use it but most players I've played with did not use a mic did not set up other players and did not play as the goalie. So if you want a fifa experience don't play this. This is not fifa with cars it just isn't but what it is an extremely fast paced game where you use hot wheels type cars to score goals and to defend and you can do both with mutiple different acrobatics. Every movement in this game will make you feel like a bad whether its boosting all the way down the field after a power up or diving in front of a ball and flip kicking it out of the way you will love every second of the movement and the thousands of players playing it can promise that. The way you become the best at this game is to think around the chaos look for the openings and most importantly have fun because if you beat yourself up over one missed shot it will affect your game tremendously. So get this game and when you do have funEric
"The devs need to stop dissing the playerbase and blaming them being ""bad"" because they won't fix basic gameplay issues (lobby balance hook camping hook trapping facecamping infinite loops sabo rushes and more). Really sad because this game could be effing FANTASTIC if they actually fixced the issues and didn't just nerf every perk in the game trying to ""balance"" it. A year in and they STILL haven't fixed glitches that have been in the game since day one.Instead they keep adding paid DLC killers.It could be amazing I like it decently enough but it's frustrating to see the dev team make random dev decisions instead of planning well and implementing actual solutions. Don't bother unless it is on a massive sale."

Dark souls with dinosaurs. +co op
PlayerUnknown is a cuck
no.
They might not have made all that much innovation in terms of gameplay but what they did do is release the best version of the standard battle royale game out there.
DO NOT BUY
can't keep up anymore with online.... i just can't
One of the most fun games I've played in a while. Hours of fun and 100% worth the money
optimize the game already lmao
its a cool game but my fps is stuck on 10 idk how to fix it i play on a windows pc and still its terrible i looked up several youtube vids on how to fix but nothing will work
An extremely good idea ruined by lots of jankiness poor controls and a lot of non sensical design choices. Terrible inventory management terrible audio terrible netcode terrible balance terrible graphics considering the hardware you need to run it decently. Fortnite *which uses the same engine * does all of the above better and I consider Fortnite a kids game.Edit GOTY 2018?! If they haven't reprogrammed and borderline reworked the entire thing this is very far from that. Unless you enjoy waiting around finally getting into a game with 99 other masochists looting with EXTREMELY rough/slow controls for 20 minutes and getting one shot sniped by no fault of your own.
Literally had to change my rating for this game. I was very supportive for PUBG. I gave it a chance and I also gave Fortnite a chance. But after seeing and reading about PUBG sueing Fortnite again for 'copyrighting'. I just have to give this game a super negative review. It's absolutely ridiculously that they re doing what they re doing. Fortnite got their games under control. I don t have a single hiccup. But after days and days for weeks to months. I still have optimization problems cheating problems and just problems after problems with this game. Don t forget about the stupid loot boxes where you have the buy every keys for every boxes. The customizing is unappealing. It s so dull and just plain out boring. PUBG is like the now of DC and Fortnite s the Marvel. Stop suing other companies when you re NOT original. Focus more of your damn game. Fix the bugs and bugs and bugs! FIX IT! Stop being an immature baby stand the heck up and fix the darn thing. Geez
I can not find any matches. I am still trying to find people playing this guy. I am looking forward to playing it some time soon or I will just get a refund.
Awesome game!

If you do not have a controller do not bother buying... ever.
Horrible decision to send a desist. EA Rockstar Take 2 all have shown their true colors. They don't give a about you it's all about the money. All that hardwork and man power put into it out of love and you crap it away because of your greed.
Best Game involving cars.

good game D
Terrible game. Playing as the killer and trying to hook survivors never works.. The popup never comes up. All the maps have extreme balance issues some maps having too many pallets and some having little to none. This game needs a major fix. Fix your game.
Hackers in 90 % of the games I played and also got banned 2 times for killing hackers on my team.
Also ich spiele Rust erst wenige Tage aber muss sagen bis auf die Lags oder noch ein paar Bugs ist das Spiel schon recht lustig.Wer nicht gleich beim ersten mal wenn er geraided oder getötet wird aufgibt wird schon viel spaß mit diesem Game haben.Es ist wie ich finde sehr Benutzerfreundlich und Einsteiferfreundlich man bekommt auf anhieb gezeigt wie man was bauen kann in diesem Punkt einfacher als bei Minecraft D
Look I've had my ups and downs with Rust since I bought it. But it has been and still is an amazing game. The developers work incredibly and you always see progress. This is not just a game that nothing changes in its constantly changing. New things new ideas best 20$ I've spent. When I get a little burnt out I take a break come back a month or two later and its like a brand new game! 10/10 would Rust again.
I'm sure everyone is mostly concerned about the optimization and that's understandable. But PLEASE make the motorcycles less y than they are. As in make them more stable than being able to do a Triple 360* Backflip from a 1ft elevated mount of dirt.On a side note if you could make it so that the gun is armed when the magazine is IN the gun and not when the reload animation is finished that would be a small but fantastic update.
good game
"This review is for the people who are curious about the game and thinking of buying this game.For singleplayer purposes Pros Great Story (nice character depth funny and twisted plot) Good graphics Long story (around 10 20 hours of story and more if you roam around)Cons Some objectives can be boringThats all i can think of.Now lets talk about Online experience.For starters i dont really care about modding.so i won't be talking about how ""stopping mod support"" decision changed the game.Pros Nice plot on heists Good co op or online teaming experience PvP available To earn money you can do heists you can do business(that contains stealing and selling) or motorclub business Mediocre character building optionsCons HACKERS.I'm not talking about some guy with infinite ammo.Hackers in this game have GOD MODE.Yes you read it right.You can find out hackers almost in any server(happens a lot).They can teleport you to somewhere and kill you.They dont get hurt they have infinite ammo they have infinite money.I mean come on wtf is this cr*p... You will see people begging for money in servers INFINITE LOADING TIME.Seriously it takes more than 10 minutes to connect to a server.Then it takes like 2 5 minutes more to find a suitable server or find your friend.If somehow your game crashes it will take the same process again.Result You can play it with your friends but be aware hackers can find you or you may wanna kill yourself for fun while waiting for the loading screens"
i'm playing rust i have my own server and in my opinion this game can be very addicting and exiting but i think they should take the game in a better direction then just a weird COD pvp map. no semi autos no modern tech of any sort. it should be like hundreds of years after the apocalypse and man has reverted back to caveman times and has just reinvented black powder. crude BP grenades made out of clay jugs and bits of flint nap for shrapnel better bows and cross bows flint knives and spears and more building veriety such as lean tos' huts shades etc. not just wooden structures that all look the same. and i want to see spear tech in it i wanna chuck spears at my dears!
its hardmobile version is easier
Running simulator. Once you get good loot you just move to the middle of the circle and hide for forty minutes. Extremely boring.
Dead By Daylight Is A Very Fun Game To Play With Ur Friends. It Is Challenging It's Fun It's Everything You Wished For A Game Like This. Keep Up The Good Work!
Good things CraftingBuildingBasic needs (Eat Drink)Bad things HelicopterAnimals that can walk through wallsFast depletion of basic needsRandom playable character (I got Asian guy when played first now i m a naked bald white woman)Very unintelligent player baseShort version.Senseless game with no goal game modes or anything else that can make it fun for me. Playing alone is boring playing with other people Death. You can spend many hours building something cool and then some player will attack you for no good reason. Very few animals and they can kill you easily if you don t have ranged weapon. You can t even hide in house. They will walk through walls!. Don t want to spend time on crafting? Okay kill everyone then. That s all you can do in this game. Kill or build. Same boring locations envious helicopter pilot that will kill you if you have something better than rock in your inventory. Do i need to mention optimization? I will skip that. How long this game in EA? Few years?
I really want to like this game but i cant. I feel like every time i play its the same thing over and over. The game is so toxic that you cant leave your base without being killed.Even when om naked i get killed.
Playing this game for the first time. Scored 2 goals. It was my happiest first time ever in my gaming history.Edit Servers are crappy...
Nice game but you can please make loading screen more shortly ?? With out that GTA V is a really nice game ...Oh.. one more thing .... can you please do to make easyer to make money ?? Thank you TheRedEye !!
Take 2 of my fingers up in the air in a 'V' shape Take Two Interactive Software Inc.
Solid gameplay still definitely needs refinement but it has a ton of potential. Dev's have been active and consistantly fixing issues. Still early access but like I said it is solid. Worth the $30 for sure. I have quite a few hours on record and have had a blast with my buddies.
Steaming pile of They flushed 9 months down the drain delaying the release of the PC version. They had AMPLE time to make the game playable on a keyboard and mouse... But it's... Unplayable. Swimming is a disaster. Submersibles helicopters? Is this a joke? I want a refund and a written apology from the in bred deformed FAS baby who allowed this game to be released in this form. Absolute mockery.
Good game but eploited by Hacks and Cheaters. Soft panishments only for cheaters.
Better than fifa
Turns out the devs can't keep their promise of not adding a paid only loot system akin to cs go. I fear this will become one of the many early acces cash grabs if the devs continue down this path.
Many of the derank bug 0 Really sad T Tbut the game is really good too if them fix it
A bike can destroy a light pole but a tank cant run over a bush10/10 best game ever

Worst game in the world. I have never seen so many bugs in one game and by the way developers dont even try to fix them.

"This game is fantastic and worth every penny. Unlike most games that require ""skill"" this game requires ACTUAL skill. There are no buffs. No gear. The only person that can increase your capability...is you getting better at the game.Thankfully this process in and of itself is extremely fun. You will cackle madly at how bad you are when you first start this game. The flipping the demolitions the ball bouncing everywhere...it's an absolute blast! (pun intended)And as time goes by no matter where you are as a player...there is always a lot of fun to be had. So buy it already and jump in!"

Will crash on you 24/7 no question. Devs generally uninterested in the issue. Bug report doesn't work must manually register and post on forum and hope it gets seen.Other than that when it runs it's good
Broken.
I love this game even though I'm total at it. That seems to be the general consensus.

Product received for free. this game are awesome
Product received for free. I've already added over 200 mods to my game and its extremely stable I'd say my list of mods are about 75% complete that other 25% are mods that I'm hoping will be ported over once SKSE64 is out. With that being said the SKSE64 beta coming out around mid march the SSE nexus is going to sky rocket with mods both old and new so thats something to look forward to for anyone who has a copy of special edition and enjoys modding.I havent gotten much playtime compared to the original skyrim though only because I wanted to hold off until SKSE64 comes out. On the original skyrim I've logged about 600+ hours )
My review is complete honest.So this game &gt Gameplay is fine there is nothing really wrong of course it needs some tweaks depending on what but gameplay overall is fine. &gt Graphics game looks ok it isnt much of a big deal... its like a downgrade from arma 3. &gt Optimization IT SUCKS REALLY FUUUUUKING BAD. For some users (including me) sometimes or maye most of the time when you spawn your textures (houses especially) wont load and ive tried a couple of fixes and nothing will help. &gt Community heard some ppl crying about hackers well i dont know.. didnt really find any since i started playing or i didnt saw anything suspicious all tho.. its a game hackers will always exist in the end. &gt OPINION SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME? Well id say yes and no... MOSTLY NO! the game is good but the optimization s*its on everything if u are ready to go on fps drops missing textures and all that s*hit then buy it if not wait till further patches.My review will change in the future if the game improves but for now i wil go with a freakin NO NO! p.s 8gb ram gtx 1070 i5 3470 3 2Ghz cant say my rig is good but neither bad for a piece of .... like this.
SERVER I GOT A WALL HACK EVERY BEGGING OFF A MATCH SO THAT MEAN I CAN'T OPEN THOSE ING DOOR
start game play prologue game is surprisingly still kind of good even with my computer play franklin's beginning part with the car game legit stops game crashes start up game but use multiplayer lamar calls me in my apt. game won't let me move lamar calls again lamar calls again LAMAR I CAN'T ANSWER PLS DON'T BE MAD!!!!!!! gets kicked from multiplayer server for being idle lamar calls me irl says he hates me now10/10 would cry over Lamar hating me again
145 hours and I am still dreadful. This is one of the few games that feels like an actual sport and it has been fascinating to see how the way the game is played has evolved over the years. I doubt there are many left who have never played it but it is hands down one of the best video games ever.
I have 1k hours on GTA V.... had no cheats..... now Im banned foreverGG R*better create good anti cheat nor a update with few cars
Games hella fun! one the best gun play impact feeling ever! 20/10

"This game is worth the effort of learning if you have a general grasp on aiming and situational awareness If you do not possess both of these you will find the game challenging and your quality of play will greatly diminish as the zone ""constantly F**k's you"". Pay attention. Alt look. know that some actions have conciquences. please play smarter not harder!"
very good.
good game
I like playing it! Very good
Great game and a lot of fun!
fix the lag spikes
I can play the game but its to laggy but i bet its fun.
Really fun once you start playing it's hard to stop.
yea its a pretty good game.
Very fun

"I've played this game for 10 12 hours and suddenly can't play this game anymore.I've tried redownload this game and done all the rockstart support told me to do and it's still not working.It was first ask me to do activation code but now it says ""Unable to access rockstar servers. Activation of GTA V requires an internet connection."" http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 739561911Are u kidding me...?"
It's great to know that a company values money over the satisfaction of their customers (sarcasm). It was a blast to play through the singleplayer mode bacause it offered a cool storyline. What made singleplayer even better was the ability to add mods to the game that basically just continued the game past its storymode whether it be adding cool new cars that the COMMUNITY has taken the time to make or even just messing around with a menu that can change the gravity change the playermodel and do many other things. Recently I have been playing online with my friends and I am just amazed at how each update added to multiplayer includes cars or property that is well over 2 million in game dollars. When you complete all of the heists you can get up to around 3 million as long as it's your first time. That sounds like a lot of cash until you see the reveal of a new update that introduces trucks with guns and supercars that are priced at over 2 mil. Or you could spend your money on some of the new ways to make money through dlc such as exporting cars or gunrunning. Through many weeks of grinding to make money you can finally purchase just one of the things that allow you to purchase something along the lines of a rocket bike. You could easily feel proud of your progress or you could also come to the realization that all of those weeks of grinding gave you absolutely no entertainment but rather just stress. What many people have already done inside of Grand Theft Auto V is cheat in cash online just so they can keep up with the numerous updates. It was understandable that Rockstar has tried their best to remove modders and hackers in ONLINE mode but removing mods in singleplayer? That's just taking it too far. What I have come to realize about this game is that it is fun only if you have money. Call me poor but Rockstar seriously needs to come out with a update that improves the game itself by adding abilities and usefulness of the iFruit phone apps that is of no cost to the player for example the kicking and melee feature in the biker update. We need more updates and less DLC.
Not a place for casual gamers
At first I was angary at this game. Very angary. Until I realized that the point of this new kind of online game is not to be fun but just to keep you playing.Since I have understood this I have simply bought a couple of shark cards and just farm gta$ from my nightclub while my friends go broke. This is my first advice to anyone.Ok now to my review.There are many theories what GTA 5 is. Some say it is the greatest game of all time. I found it is many things at the same time 1. GTA is the best loading screen simulator on the market. Since I own a SSD booting Windows now takes less than 10 seconds. For whatever reason however booting GTA5 takes around 10 minutes and sometimes goes on infinitely. (But the loading screens are updated every couple of seconds and some of them are the nicest you can imagine.)2. GTA is machine to transform lots of your precious time into ugly supercars that look like sanitary rags. (This one is the answer when I apply the scientific method when I just consider what I put in and got out of the system.)3. GTA is a garage space simulator. There are now over 500 cars in the game but you can only have 6 garages so much of your time is spent driving from one to the other. This is actually fun because you must really think hard how the garage system even works when you have 10 cars in all your garages and want to exchange 2 cars (but without being able to take out more than 1 at a time). (Tip the accepted solution is often to drive them in front of the garage and destroy them with a handgranade until you have enough space)4. GTA is consolified popamole with the worst input scheme on the PC ever. Sad but the input on PC makes no sense and almost made me quit the game. I can however guarantee you that after ca 300 hours I had learned the combinations by heart and can now put them in effortlessly like a piano player. Since then it has no longer bothered me.5. Going by the number of disturbed millenials you will encounter it will also be the future cause for a great many broken off university careers suicides and psychotherapy but that's a characteristic of all good games isn't it?6. GTA is a cheaters heaven in which hardly a session passes without a modder placing you in a cage or setting you on fire or some Russian kid with a totally impossible 8000 level terrorizing the whole lobby. (It's kind of helpful though too because if someone is better than you you can just accuse anyone of being a cheater and get away with it.)7. GTA is a futuristic battlefield. This one is funny because everyone expects a game about stealing cars but it's actually a deathmatch arena type game with most people these days using flying motorbikes and armed helicopters and if you want to stand any chance you should at least drive around in an armored tank.Last and most of all GTA will be your new second job! If you want to spend time in a game lots of time then look no further! Everything in this game costs lots of money in order to make money you need to play missions until your index finger will hurt from pressing the W key. In fact even killing yourself costs 500$ in this game!! When you have done missions for some hundred hours (and realize that you earned less than a shnuck) you will realize you need to buy the facilities which cost millions. And then you need more money to upgrade the facilites. And so on.Lastly it's strangely addictive because the graphics engine is one of the best on the PC and the city simulation is pretty darn great (although Rockstar intentionally disabled most features in GTA Online). I also met not only autistic millenials but eventually made some really good friends in this game and overall had a great time.My advice Just don't get angary if someone kills your level 1 character with a rocket salvo from the sky. It happened to all of us and you will get used to it with time and secondly those level 500 players are usually not that good from playing nothing but GTA for the last 5 years and you will soone be able to kill them too.Highly Recommended!
I am contemplating suicide.
This game is actually really good. The devs are pretty great and listen to the fanbase and they always deliver new stuff to do and get. All extras are cosmetic there aren't any boosts and there's no such thing as pay to win. It's purely a skill based game. Overall really really great. Highly recommend 9/10
one of the best
Almost 2 years since pubg was early access. I admit bugs were fixed and servers are better but theres still too many places require to be fixed.
Pros More realistic and competitive than H1Z1What we wished DayZ standalone was.developers have a real passion for the game.Cons currently has a lot of bugs and glitches.In the games defense it is still in alpha.
VERY GOOD GAME. AWESOME MODS FOR SINGLEPLAYER. 100% RECCOMEND! GET GRAPHICS MOD AND EXTRA CAR DEFORMATION MOD FOR AWESOME GAMEPLAY! JUST TRY IT OUT!!THUMBS UP!!10/10GET IT SOON!!
Hours of fun. The GtA series has always been great but GTA 5 has really proven itself worthy of one of Rockstars best games. GTA online is awesome for just messing around with friends and the single player features a detailed storyline.GTA has probably the best free roam gameplay and never gets boring. I strongly recomend this game to all who seek adventure and the ability to cause mayhem amoung the streets of innocents...... TRUST ME ITS FUN
This game was alot of fun but with china..not so much.
After having 300+ hours and a couple of chicken dinners i can say the game has 50/50 luck and skill ratio. Ever since i bought the game i've had optimization problems whilst reading numerous threads about fixes and applying them. I had no success but i didin't care much since it was a new expirience on the market. I was a diehard PUBG fan until today where (If i can use the analogy with other Battle Royale game) Fortnite which has no hit register problems and is pure skill(you can turn a losing fight in your favor if you are skilled enough) easy to handle on the PC and it has no negative comments against optimization is my go to.
this is the best game i ever played )
The only thing i have against this game is the WIPES... I really enjoy to build a great base but knowing that my base will vanish in 1 month is realy bad for players focused on defending their bases and creating them... Hope this change in the future because pvp gets boring sometimes and all you really want to do in this game then is to protect and create your base... At least thats my point of view.
Its a good game with good story and multiplayer but when some modder in GTA Online teleport you you get baned
Product received for free. Good
Great Monster Hunter game as always. Released with some bugs but they will get fixed very soon. Dont be afraid do play this game for 15+ hours Monster has alaways been hard to start. If you are an beginner to the series give it a try with at least 15+ hours otherwise you wont see how the game really is.
plz fix the game
My Friend has a slightly lower end pc than i do and he plays on medium settings i have to play on very low and half the time my ing world doesn't load. In fix the damn game bluehole!Every patch you realese the ing game get a whole hell of a lot worse i am unistalling this game until i can land from the plane and my world actually load in. this piece of garbage until they stop pulling a ubisoft #WeNeedOperationHealth
Every single online game I have been in I have seen a hacker.I've been set on fire after each respawn caged blown up thrown across the map been blocked by a ufo been teleported etc. etc. all because I killed someone and they got butt hurt. Avoid the game it's overrun and not worth anymore.
RNG microtransactions in a paid game. No.
Amazing game 10/10
I used to be addicted to playing Rocket Leauge. Well I still am but I used to too.
垃圾服务器服务器垃圾还卖加速器这波运营很厉害
I would defo recommend this game its fun and thrilling at the same time the self satisfactions of building your own base and defending it is amazing sometimes the game can loose its sense of fun but it will soon come back if anyone wants a cheapish game that is being updated constantly then i would recommend rust it has its problems but they will soon be fixed.
I can now experience having sex with a hooker in first person and touch strippers in first person 10/10
Absolutely horrible. The game only get me 20 fps on a mid end pc while All newest games run smoothe on ultra.Uncountable bugs random crashes ingame lag and physics where cars randomly flip resulting in death and a wasted 20min spent invested playing a round in the laggy game. The idea is very good. But this game as it is now runs like complete .
5/7.Needs more hats.
BOO
10/10
THIS IS A HORIBLE GAME DONT BUY THIS CRAP
This game is fantastic no more to say. Buy it play it win it!
Great game I just hope that they can block the cheaters and hacks

i play 8 game of nergigante and i disconnected 7 time naicee
Taking away our modding take away there revenue
The game optimization is bad. UP untill now I had to constantly do fixes according to the internet but since the last update I can't even fix the game to work anymore. Great way to spend 30$
I picked this gem up shortly after release. I had no idea there was a predecessor on Playstation 3 Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars. This game is absolutely ridiculous. So ridiculous it has caused me to neglect many other games I have impulsively picked up during Steam sales. This game has been such a problem that I have put in over whopping 400 hours. That is just nuts over 16 days of gaming. In all honesty I love this game. All the various cars you can choose from and all the many possible customization options are dope. This review is way late and the latest update is the Aquadome and crate system. All just awesome. My only gripe is the fact I do not like that the crate keys are about a buck a piece and that you can often get repeat items out of the crates. If there are just a small group of people to play with trading becomes hard and crates build up due to the fact I cannot justify spending money constantly to open items that I will most likely already have. In my honest opinion I believe each key should be about 25 cents with a minimum four pack being a dollar. Just pick it up and play. It is fun. I currently game with an XBone One Elite Controller and use two paddles on the back for ball view and drifting/sliding. Pretty rad.
I have yet to get past the server list on the play screen will not connect. Would be nice to play ...... guess I found a bug? Glitch? or Steam has a problem.
Rust is a very fun very engaging build a house simulater and survival game. Enven in its alpga stages it gets good reveiws and is all around liked.
Excellent Game... More fun ( in SQUADS ) if you have friends... (Moreover it's an extremely realistic game !
Product received for free. Recieved this game as a gift. Overall an amazing game here in PC! I origionally had it on xbox one but it CANNOT compare to pc gameplay and experiance. 10/10!
It's a good game to spend some time with friends
too many bugs and cheaters game never optimized
take two? more like avenue
Rocket league is a simple yet dynamic game for all skill levels. Starting out as a rookie you will rise through ranks and playstyles alike. Where new players will have great fun in learning the elemental controls and hitting the ball where it hurts more advanced players will want to start testing the merits of flying. Having conquered these at an elementary level the fun starts for real. There's really no limit to the amount of idiotic tenuously difficult flying actions you can perform. And oh imagine the joy of leaving your opponents dumbfolded in sight of your absurdly awesome goals!
This is veri bad i not like cuz game give me girl character. . I am big man with beard wtf!? no plz
Product received for free. I love this game
Product received for free. Best of best
best game you will ever play once your good. Gets you triggered but makes you 10/10
"This game is amazing for relaxing and having a good laugh after being beaten to death by a guy named ""A fountain of ""."
THE BEST SURVİVAL GAME ON STEAM!!!
decent needs to nerf ladders
Product received for free. Start is bit slow but after 2 hours I was completely submerged into the great story and atmosphere.
Met some naked guy who admired my foreskin requested death by having arrows shot through his . 10/10
game play Fortnite/H1Z1/The Hunt/any of the 300 games coming out in 2018 that will feature a battle royale mode/any game that gives a damn about it's audience even a shred of how much bluehole does/anything but Bluehole
Best game I have ever purchased. Story is great multiplayer is even better and the DLC (free) that has been added is a great addition instead of the constant paid DLC that should be free other games have.
Gret gem 12/10 recomend dis
This game is an awesome survival raiding shooter game! if you want to end up spending multiple hours building a base and seeing if it can hold up against players trying to break in or you want to chase down air drops and get the loot before anybody or raid bases and loot rad towns and learn how to craft everything then this game is for you! 11/10 everyone should buy
This game is too much fun to pass on. If it's on sale make sure to pick it up. Both casual and competitive players can coexsist together in harmony.
very fun to play but if you want the full experience and go try hard mode have to buy all DLC.
And the Second time I've been banned from GTA Online for no reason. With a Steam Account of 350+ games and no bans on any of them why would I need to hack or glitch any game. Screw you rockstar I guess you're running out of money and need every player te purchase the game again to survive.
Rust certainly has its pros and cons. It's definatly not worth the current price point I bought it during early access for pretty cheap. It's not at all suited for single player. For sure it needs to be played on multi person servers or with friends on a private server. It's pretty simple in regards to gameplay. The challenges come from the threat of other people and thats pretty much it. At least in games like ARK and 7 Days there's those other danger elements that make it more playable alone. The modded servers can be pretty fun. The official servers are completely toxic and are unfortunately the only way to get achievements. If you have other friends who play then its worth getting on sale. If its just you and you're not comfortable playing on multi person servers alone then I suggest looking for something else.
Good Game !
I LAIK DIS GAME FOR REALLL GAIISSSS.. 10/10
Love this game I have 900 hours on it. I think it is beyond epic and is very addicting Anyone add me to play?
Would be even better if it included native VR (Oculus Rift) support...
I love the game but starting to hate it because of all the ING HACKERS!!!!!!!!
This is an awesome game you can do it all xD
not fun. straight up. why do people play this game?????
Super smash brothers melee is an instant classic. Nintendos all star lineup of characters hits home once again bringing nostalgia to older gamers as well as fun a new playstyle for the younger generation. It's options for free for all or 2v2 battles creates a never ending array of possibilities on the battle stage. I personally have enjoyed many epic hours with my friends. Its refreshing to see a game in 2017 go back to the classic local multiplayer that my friends and I enjoyed in my youth. Overall I would rate this latest title in Nintendos lineup a perfect 10/10 score. I haven't had this much fun in years.
As of the alst update the building has been ruined. Ya short review but if the main game mechanic is broken no reason to reccomend it.
With over 100 hours in the game I can now say I'm sad about the state of this game. When I purchased this game it was early access and we waited forever for the one update to hopefully fix the insanely poor buggy game. The game is fun and its a insane to actually win . But the combat works better with close quater combat rather than the games constantly wanting long range. Most of the guns you will find are close quarters with a splattering of long range guns (good luck finding a scope to use said rifle once you find it). Then we are lead into the cheaters and poor optimized game. At the current moment most cheaters are seeming to come from china and the developer refuses to give china their own region locked server even though that would solve and Unknown himself calls the players asking for that xenophopic for even suggesting it. The developer seems to priotize how the game looks rather than make the game not run like even with a rig with more than enough power to run it. Please fix the game. It can be fun. Please focus on the bugs and the preformance. Listen to the community on this one because we have a point sometimes.
Goodgame with horrible server
its great
This game has tons of content free content updates and endless emergent gameplay. Been playing since the 360 release (two character transfers later) and I still don't get bored of it. I highly recommend it.I also want my Steam Awards badge because meaningless and inconsequential gains like these make me feel better about myself.
Really great game many quality of life improvements to crafting and gathering especially. Beautiful world armor sets and weapons. And most importantly Cat costumes.
A good gaming experience recommended enjoyment process in player. But the server is not stable enough.
Decent game. Long grind. They are finally balancing out the game and everyone is throwing a fit. I might start playing a game if they do a full balance (including DS and Selfcare). Let's just hope the devs keep going in this direction and don't pull another Freddy.
THIS GAME IS SO GOOD I FORGOT TO EAT
For the past few days I have had this game I have been completely absorbed by the interesting and fun survival concept of this game. Although the lack of story behind this game I feel as if I'm in my characters shoes as I make tough life death decisions. I have thoroughly enjoyed this game so far and look forward to the complete game. But beware... If you are looking for a completely polished game unfortunately you won't find it here. Although it is in alpha there are many things that have to be improved which I'm sure will me adressed soon. But for now you are paying for an unfished game which may want you to leave your purchase of this game for later. Other than that I really enjoy this game even though it is in it's alpha stage and really reccomend this game. 3.5/5 For now...
Awesome game but the servers still lag alot fix that plox...
F*ck fortnite so yes love this game.
Best competitve game ive ever played excluding CS GO but even more fun
The graphics on this game now make it so much better and enjoyable!
Normally I don't write reviews but this game is so terrible that I had to rate it 3 4 out of 10. The client or the game crashes nearly everytime I play it I got stuck in the loading screen on most games and I had to drop somewhere with sh*t loots or maybe you don't join at all or get killed The textures doesn't load which means that you can't grab a gun and then you'll get killed Sh*t ton of bugs The vehicle mechanics are awful Looting system are awful You get a huge frame drop when you get into a gunfight which gives you an immense disadvantage and soon after you die.Don't waste your money on this game.
This game is good
no more mods
This is a HEAVILY chopped down review if you want my full thoughts click here https //www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/3cqffc/an_in_depth_grand_theft_auto_v_reviewrant/After over 300 hours of gameplay. I think I can give this beast a proper review. Since IV is my beloved in the franchise and the previous major installment a lot of my comparisons will be between the gameplay of GTA IV and GTA V. Is that biased? Very. So take this with a grain of salt from a IV fanboy.GTA V is a great sandbox game but when you compare it to the previous iterations of the GTA franchise it feels as if something was left behind. There s so much to cover in this game I think I ll go bullet point by bullet point in order to better organise my ramblings. I will be covering the three core gameplay mechanics of every GTA game. Driving combat and story. I will also be talking about the multiplayer since that was where a majority of my time was spent.(If you want a quick summery skip to the bottom of this review) DRIVING At the core of every GTA game is surprise driving. And man does GTA V really improve on driving. Cars have much better handling compared to IV Vice City and SA. GTA IV always had slippery cars that took quite a while to learn. GTA V improves upon this with better breaking tighter controls and more realistic handling. There s even some nice attention to detail when it comes to driving. Car statistics double clutch acceleration working internal gauges fuel that drains if the gas can is breached and more. The driving has improved so much there are racing crews and communities within the game. So hats off to you Rockstar.However a lot of their statistics are hidden in the game s code. The game records four vague stats about every vehicle in the game. Top speed Acceleration Braking and Handling. These stats are completely not indicative of the real performance of cars since there s so much more going on under the hood and some stats flat out lie. For instance the Bravado Gauntlet muscle car completely beats the Vapid Dominator in terms of stats having significantly better Speed and Acceleration. Yet the Vapid Dominator is one of the best muscle cars in the game. Why? Because the stats don t take into consideration torque wheel traction weight durability oversteer and understeer horsepower and so much more. COMBAT Combat in GTA V sucks plain and simple. So if you don t want to hear me whine about it feel free to skip ahead to the story and mark that as my opinion. GTA has always had clumsy melee systems but at least IV s system was functional albeit awkward. This however is a joke. If you go bare knuckle against someone you re in for one hell of a time. When you fight you spastically flail your fists and legs at the other person like you ve just taken muscle relaxers or suffer from spinal paralysis. You will brawl like none of the characters has ever clenched a fist before until someone falls down dead. For the controls there s a button specifically for your kicks however pressing the attack button (which there are two of that do the same attacks) will randomly intermix some of these weak shoves into your combo . Blocking is only really effective for using counters which is the only consistent way to look like you know what you re doing while knocking someone down. Guns are disappointing to say the least. Rockstar games aside from Max Payne 3 have always had good but not fantastic gunplay. The guns sound awful one even sounds less threatening than my airsoft gun. Fire rates on pistols and automatic weapons are also terrible. Pistols fire once every half second and the AK fires about as fast as a Civil War gatling gun. I must give props to the detailed animation work that went into reloading and firing but that cannot forgive the horrible feel of the weapons. Not only the the guns limp to fire but shooting someone is equally disappointing. In GTA V when you shoot almost anyone they immediately flop to the ground like a dead fish sporting almost no animation. In actuality they have a lot more health left so half of the gunplay is you shooting at bodies already on the ground trying to finish them off.Health is another major issue that GTA V has. GTA V switches all of this up for the worst. Your health regenerates slowly if you are standing still in cover or driving up to half of your health bar. Let s just take a moment to absorb how annoying that is. I can understand regenerating fully or regenerating a little so you don t die an embarrassing death to stubbing your toe but half? On top of this you die. Fast. And to make matters worse enemies are deadly accurate. All enemies with all weapons in all situation. I cannot tell you how many times I have been hit from an untrained two bit thug blind firing a pistol with one hand from several meters away. If you thought random shotgun cops in GTA IV was bad imagine that as the entire combat experience. STORY GTA V takes a bold step in a new direction by introducing three unique characters at the same time that you can freely switch between. This is quite a cool idea but unfortunately none of them are quite as memorable because of it. Michael is bitter Franklin is fed up and Trevor is crazy. I want to love these characters so much more than I do since the actors give such great performances and the writing is spot on. But splitting the story among three characters while keeping the game length the same means they re much more shallow. The connections between the main and side characters are less significant and as a whole our protagonists feel like the one dimensional pieces of a better character. Michael is the most relatable character among the three having a family you interact with frequently. His backstory is fleshed out the most having history and revealing that he did things to get out of his life of crime for his family. Franklin might as well not exist in the story. He s a pawn throughout the entire thing following the orders of someone else and never taking things into his own hands. He really could have been replaced by anyone. Hell Lamar is a significantly more interesting character because he did dumb things on his own. Not to mention having hilarious writing. I guess Franklin is supposed to be the player more of a blank slate that you can identify with. Trevor good god Trevor. Trevor got the best writing the best performance the zaniest missions the most unique characteristics and does everything for himself. But he s a bit too much he doesn t really have a side you can identify with as human. In fact the game goes out of the way by making him feel entirely inhuman. When we re introduced to him he confronts and kills a character that you played as in a previous GTA game. I was this character I learned about him fought through his struggles and came to love him. Seeing Trevor kill him without any sort of ceremony sucked. It hampered my ability to love Trevor. CONCLUSION I ve enjoyed my time in GTA V. Don t get me wrong despite my griping it s a fun open world sandbox and it s done well. But after dealing with it s major to minor issues for 300+ hours I ve had enough. This is where GTA V and I depart. Overall I cannot recommend this game. I felt like I ve had more of a negative experience coming out of this game than coming in. There s so much more I could talk about but I ve already outstayed my welcome and probably off a few people along the way. This rambling wasn t to complain about a product or on people who enjoy it but rather to show people that it isn t a groundbreaking flawless game like the Metacritic score may suggest. It has its faults some rather large ones and GTA V doesn t do anything better than previous installments can do. Which is why this gets my thumbs down.
its ok
This is a great game ruined by money grubbing t. I'm not sure if it's Rockstar or Take Two I don't care. I'm never buying another one of their games no matter how much I want to experience them. Their business practices have alienated me and a lot of gamers like me.Single player DLC that was promised has been delayed indefinitely because they're raking in too much cash with GTA O and don't want people to stop spending money on it. That me off.I was banned for using single player mods. Lost all of my progress which took a lot of grinding since I don't waste money on shark cards no matter how badly they try to make it impossible to progress without them. Whatever I won't play GTA O. Honestly it's a cobbled together piece of that serves only as a cash machine and they don't do much to hide that.Now they've banned single player mods altogether. That was the last straw. Rockstar and Take Two can eat a
Great Game.
The developers are too incompetent to actually divide their multiplayer content from singleplayer so they had to shoot up the whole modding scene for this game by calling for a C&amp D on OpenIV killing All modding possibilities for not only the single player version of GTA 5 but the whole scene for older RAGE Engine based titles including GTA 4 itself.Their reason 'to counter hackers'. Let me tell you most of them were already using hacks that were written on C++ &amp not through the modding tool which the game also had an update to disable any modded clients from entering GTA O months prior to the t done from T2 Interactive &amp Rockstar Games.You ed up Rockstar/T2 you and off with any new product that's in any form related with you. I am not going to continue funding companies that go through their way to restricting modding making it either impossible/inaccessible for others or putting it behind a paywall.Support OpenIV by heading down to the link below &amp signing that petition along with not spending a single dime on any product of T2I/R* because what businesses/companies/industries get affected from more than negative opinion on their products is actual loss of income.https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
This is a game that's primarily about hunting monsters. Each monster is basically a boss fight in most other games and since most of what you'll be doing is fighting these monsters you're basically doing boss fights all the time. Between a bunch of different weapons that all handle differently and the variety of monsters to hunt and make equipment out of which lets you go after stronger monsters the gameplay loop is a lot of fun and the combat is very good. The combat itself is very good with some weapons that are very powerful but committing to an attack can leave you vulnerable to fast and agile weapons that are more about a lot of smaller blows and continuously attacking the monster as much as you can.Monster Hunter as a series has a lot of grind to it and this one is no exception. I'm not someone who enjoys an extreme amount of grind but the amount of variety of options in this game lets me switch things up when I want to if I ever get bored of using the same weapon type. On top of that there are a bunch of additional monsters that have been added to the console version of the game that PC players are steadily getting (and it's all free and more recently becoming more frequent) so every so often there's something new to do once you've hit the soft end of the game.Overall I really like this game and I've been playing it on a Steam Controller which works great as well. This was my first monster hunter game and I look forward to more content being added to this game as well more Monster Hunter games being released on PC!
Verb Rust 3rd person present rusts past tense rusted past participle rusted gerund or present participle rusting1. To Rust inside one's game library.''The game was so unoptimized that he let it RUST away inside his backlog.'' Synonyms Corrode oxidize become rusty tarnish and some other neglectable stuff.
Take Two clearly only cares about your $$$$ and nothing else not the loyalty to the franchise not the countless hours youve spent immersed in the GTA world and certainly not the hard work you put into making the experience better for the GTA community. I cant support anything from Take Two with such regressive business practices.
Great game (y) !!
Rust is a game about surviving you can survive agains the animals and other hazards like players or die trying. This game a sureal feel to it so i reccomend playing in the dark have fun and good luck!
Awesome game if you love hitting balls with rocket propelled cars. Enough said.
I can't even play it. It just gives me a black window when I try to launch it.
This game is awesome i recommend to anyone from casual or even if you never gamed before to hardcore gamer literally anyone can grab a controler and enjoy this game ! 8/10
"""Hey you know what I haven't played rocket league in a couple of days yeh let's go play it! And... try hard try hard everywhere oh they called me a and gay cause I'm bad...ok time to play counter strike global offensive. 4/7"
Pretty good game if you have friends or want to solo it.
a nice game to play with friends
battlegrounds is a good fantastic battle and the feels you get are so real it feels like your in the game.I love this game and im really bad but every now and then i get that kill.now im going to say how good it looks 10/10 its really pretty.monthly updates this game is a good standpoint for what an early access game should be like. every now and then you get the glitchy plane lobby and around areas but still its in early access and its just going to get better.if you are chosing if you should buy it i say yes. my overall rating 8/10 because of the glitchs low frame rate and little things that could put this up to a 9.5/10
...the absolute dregs of humanity coming together to ruin the lives of every man woman and child they come across. Basically the virtual embodiment of my home town.10/10 would bring back painful memories of childhood again
a awesome game i love the series i recommend this game to anyone who loves hunting and crafting games.
"Pros Addictive as hell. Often find myself saying ""Just one more game"" Finding/joining games is fast and easy. Usually join a 100 person server under a minute. The ever collapsing ring of play keeps action focused and fast paced. Cons Servers can be *very* laggy sometimes to the point where you teleport in one place and can't move anywhere. Related to latency sometimes you can't pick up items/enter vehicles reliably. Since this is early access the game engine isn't fully optimized so FPS stays in the 60's even on lower settings. Still this game is fun as hell and gets you into the action fast."
Fire.
overrated survival gameget it if you're a kid that has nothing better to do than play video games
One of the best game i have ever played VERY ADICTING!!
The motorcycle update adds a lot to the online action and raises the stakes!
take two!
got banned when someone dropped money to me. too many hackers in this game and also stuff way to expensive. don't waste money on this trash.
want to show this to producer this is a terrific and terrible game......terrific nice characters.nice skill.make me feel like that Im really a killer....too much blood...too scary....love&amp hate this at the same time....terrible not good for a long time playing.bad texture......at least not what I expected.boring&amp meaningless goal.....!!!!Advice can you add a mod or map make it feels like a real killer game?just like THE SAW or THE ALIEN or ANYTHING....just not like noly fixing generators.....it's really stupid and meaningless....feel pretty boring about this goal....you know...fix generators and get out to nowhere....hope you can do better!
"Love and hate relationship with this game. RUST at its core is an awesome survival/building experience but the game suffers from unstable updates and optimization issues. 7/10 (Buy knowing that this game may be in ""Early Access"" forever)"
Just cant get enough of this game. Cant wait to see what the developers have in stall for the full release.

Best game ever? Best game ever.
I recently got banned when it wasnt my fault it led me to tears (
f
GG pubg said FIX network problem?? !! new update and pkt loss!!!!
1st I really like the graphics of the game. Nice and detailed and a 600$ PC can run it. 2nd The gameplay is easy to learn and as a beginner I had to get used to the fingering on my keyboard but now I can play just fine.One thing I recommend fixing though is the weird bumps that are in the landscapes sometimes and when driven over those by a vehicle you fly over even though you do not see them on your screen. Rest of the game is fricking good and I definitely recommend buying this game if you are a fan of shooting games like CS GO or H1Z1 even COD and Halo.
Its rusty
... its good... Really Really Good
it's okay I guess
Okay there is a lot of controvery surrounding this game mainly that fortnite is better but no. This game is SOOOOOOOO much better overall this game is probably one of the best games I have ever played and btw PLAY WITH FRIENDS!!
Game was great until recently now it is literally unplayable due to this hacker situation they say they are doing something about it yet they refuse to ban these people and refuse to region lock them just becasue some of them might not be hacking. meanwhile they let those who are run rampant unless you are going to hack as well i would not recomend this game because there is no way you will get anywhere near the top ten let alone win
Product received for free. Well maybe the game have a lot of bug and something harmful for us.But i don't know why i miss if i don't play this game maybe for a week because of the stereotype about this game...
Product received for free. انا اشتريت العبه والحين لازم اشتريها ......شو السبب
Great game! Endless amounts of fun supports cross platform plays well as a competitive and casual multiplayer and is fun for just about all ages. Can't get enough!
Took all my in game money even though I never used a hack or cheated at any time. but still was worth it i can't say this game wasn't a blast so thumbs up despite it all.
Great single player dog sh!t online everything is either tedious grinding or plain pay to win.
This game was fun. But without region locking there is more asians then americans on the North american servers. They ping high causing They cheat and you cannot find english speaking teammates. I cant even get a refund this is trash.
Great game Lots of fun Fashion! Very addicting
Unless your a single player person don't buy this t. Hacking is just drag and drop hacks pretty much give the modders admin they can make messages come to your screen kick you ban you etc. DO NOT BUY Spend your 30$ on something else
The only monster I wanted to kill was the handler.this game is wee weeI liked the cutscenes of the cat's making dinner though
Used to be epic game but now you cannot play in a team anymore no1 helps in the same team no1 can speak english in same team its all china once you have epic loot your team kills you and take it once you follow a chinese team dude you end up dead coz they suck anyways
best game out there

Update November 2018 Although this game is still far from polished it has come a long way since Early Access. It has a good mix of MilSim action and Battle Royale adrenaline. Some terrain (boulders and rocks in particular) could use hitbox updating Erangel could use some loot buffs and I would like to see pistols buffed but these are minor complaints. The gameplay is still solid and I keep coming back to this game!(It is also possible I wrote this review to get a badge but don't let that stop you from trying out the game)
What a fantastic game you know a game is good when you need a hacker to drop you money just to have fun )
I am all for having everyone have a chance to play against equal skill people but please region lock... whenever noon in china hits my game goes from being playable to being so laggy its almost nauseating... I can provide proof of 1 game to another on the lag situation... Please figure this out I love this game but between Chinese players coming and team killing non Chinese players or the ridiculous amount of lag whenever they switch servers... please figure something out
"1) Over zealous monitization of a full price game...go yourself2) Poor optimization with rampant desync3) Large population of cheaters (13 million banned...like it matters with an VPN you fcktards)4) PUGs in duos or squad consist of 90% Chinese who don't speak English5) I used to love this game but holy sheet it isn't beta anymore so WTF is up with the sad state of this game?6) Worth about $10.00 wait for a sale when this turd begins to circle the bowl.7) Region lock?8) 19/20 DUO games ""where are you from?"" ""China""...""see ya"""
"Alright I'd like to start this review off by saying this is not a rant on the game itself as a matter a fact i think this is a great game to play with friends or alone it will keep you busy and entertained for hours. The competative levels are great and well matched most of the time. The cars are great although i think the hitboxes need to be alittle smaller to where it is about the same size as the car and not larger than it but this is a rant on their banning system. In the past 2 weeks ive been banned 3 times. Two of them are from saying the ""F word "" multiple times in 1 game and then the third time i got banned was for telling an opposing player to stop telling his teamate that he was trash and to stop calling him bad names because his teamate after all was doing way better than him. i did not curse. I did not use any verbal terms that could hurt ones feelings i didnt even come close to saying stupid or butthead. BUT LORD HELP ME IM THE ONE TO GET BANNED FOR 72 F***ING HOURS FOR NOT EVEN SAYING ANYTHING BAD. But thank you Psyonix im proud to see you are trying to take people who are trying to just play the game without the cancer that reported me. But yes remove me from online and not him. &lt 3 thanks for your amazing ban systems!"
A game that provides that feeling of anxiety when you here a deer outside your house.
cReation club
fun
The game is filled with modders from time to time Rockstar doesn't care.
This game marks the biggest leap forward that Monster Hunter ever did. During the first half of the game the gameplay will be easy to pick up for newcomer while the second half is challenging it does everything right to bring new players and veteran together.
You don't realize how much you suck at video games before you buy this.
"i was stupid for buyng this game specially the criminal starter pack.the offline part is fine and a good game but all online experience is horrendous.Its basically a cashgrab even with the so called ""starterpack"" that IS BASICALLY A PAYWALL.. let me give an exemple you get ""for free"" a company and can act as CEO but to get it actually running you need to spend extra to buy a warehouse just to BEGIN playing a mission. after you begin finnaly playing it.... oh wait it was a setup mission not an actual mission then you get killed over and over by other online players higher leveled than you since they get rewarded for killing you and taking all you worked for. even if you do magically do this you still need to redo this mission ( driving a slow boring car for 10 km ) dozens of time just to break even in in game currencyim sure it was a thrill playing this back when it launched but if you want this game just buy a phisical copy for literally zero dollars and play offline.i wish i hadnt played offline first so i could apply for a refund"
Very Good Game But Very Bad Community
I have gone from a positive review...to a negative review but now i am definitely back to a positive review the amount of changes that just happened in the last week are amazing buy this game ASAP i have 3 4k hours i could of learnt to fly a plane in this time.But no i wouldn't change it this game is ing awesome if at first you get ruined by another player/group...build yourself up and wipe them off the island don't out.10/10 Great game &amp the best communicating developers i have ever come across do yourself a favor your subway sandwich for one day and buy this game instead worth every cent.

Got high and had to fight off aliens.10/10 would take drugs again.
Alot of fun if you can find food within the first 5 minutes of playing. Some bugs and glitches but nothing that makes it unplayable but this game would be much better if it had a singleplayer which I hope is coming soonGame Rating 6.8 7

Scorpion Kick Simulator 201510/10 would boost jump again Actual Review Alright. I'll be honest. I got this game because of the immense hype surrounding it. And OH MY LORD JESUS CHRIST get it. Now. Among the top 5 purchases I've made. Worth every cent. This game deserves your firstborn. This game is addicting extremely fun and best with friends (dont worry its still fun when solo). Psyonix did well. Game looks very nice as well but thats just icing on the cake. The physics are amazing the community is awesome... Where's the con list? Oh there's none... except the servers sometimes but the devs are really supporting the games servers now.Just get the game. Join the craze. C'mon it's football/soccer with nitro cars. What's not to like?
Funny
"Product received for free. To summarize my experience with this game so far is that I am dissappointed with the mod aspect from without starting the game yet. It prompts you to go into Bethesda.net to log in there Would be fine if you have an account otherwise prepare for the most fustrating experience of your life.My tale began innocently enough recently I just downloaded this since I have the old skyrim. So free game is free and I like free. But after downloading it and setting up my graphic settings. I was curious on to mods. I was sadden when I saw that the steam community didn't have mods for the Special Edition. And Then things went downhill after that. I saw they had Bethesda.net and wanted you to log into there. So naturally I go to the site and try to create an account since I don't have one. Well it asked for a fairly simple request with usernames. But every username that is fairly unique to me was some how ""unavailable"" aka taken. I spent a solid 30 minutes trying to come up with any username before i just gave up on that notion. I seriously would say that if you are going to get this game for the modding community don't bother. Go with the old skyrim that one is much easier to deal with and you can find mods on nexus or workshop there that is much easier to get to. Otherthan that? my impressions is the gameplay should be fine for vanilla and I will be testing that out."
There is something seriously wrong when you can empty the magazine of an AK into your enemy and they dont flinch but you die after being shot twice with a 92F. This needs some serious fixing.
The servers had antihacks and they were to strick so i would get kicked from going down a hill to fast or becuase of lag. It always did it so i was VACbanned for playing the game when it was buggy in alpha. I payed for this game for 2 people and it was over $40 and i got vacbanned becuase the game was buggy.
Just one of the best GTA games I have ever played
its like the extra fun version of fifa for pc that never was
The game is fun if you have a group of friends to play with. Otherwise it might not be the best game to buy unless you like to grind build repair upgrade and defend by yourself. I always play with my small group of friends. It's fun to kill and raid others groups in the game. The servers reset every first thursday of each month for the new updates. We usually only get on to play once we see an update add something interesting. It best to not trust anyone in this game because everyone is usually out for themselves.

"Let me just say first that I've never posted a review of any game as I normally don't induldge in games enough to be able to post a thourough enough review. I purchased this game originally just to get the game. Like a majority of people. Didn't care much for online as I just wanted to get the experience of playing GTA V on PC since it was a different feel and a brand new experience overall. I have not yet completed the single player campaign on PC as I went through it completely on next gen before the PC release. Have tried a time or two but repeating a campaign isn't something I find interest in on any game. With that said I did spend a lot of time exploring the open world and just doing what I wanted to do as I felt. That too becomes very old as would be expected when becoming so adjusted to an open world map. When I felt single player wasn't cutting it anymore I attempted to invest time in online. Rockstar does a tremendous job at adding content to this game with all of the game mode additions vehicle additions weapons and so on so I am not cutting them short in that respect. Put simply online also gets boring as time goes on. Heists become very frustrating if you don't have a large group of friends to play them on. Races are a cluster most of the time. Death match game modes are very fun for the first couple of times you play them but become very repetitive as time goes on. Don't even get me started on the open world aspect of online. When you do everything in GTA V it becomes very uninteresting. It is hard to bring yourself to press ""Play"" when you know you'll be running through the same frustrations the last time you tried. With that said there was one thing that extended my interest in GTA V. Mods. Mods kept me playing this game when I ran out of interest. Mods take up about 40% of the hrs on record that you see posted. Mods are in large part why there is any real interest in this game this late into its life. The single player campaign is fantastic. The online is.. meh. Both run out on you and mods keep a constant interest. Now that's gone and so is what interest I had left in this game. Going to help clear out some hard drive space I must say. )"
This is a very hard good game that you can have hours of fun playing.
Good game but just fix the lagg D
I got ban from Online during of last year from dirty modders and some were able to flag account for no reason... really wonderful work. and don't tell you about there customer support (cough they suck as well only copy n paste) no real help and cough calling their phone support have fun waiting for like 3 hours since they have to deal with everyone wanting to kick them for prerma banning account if they were victims of geting dirty money... rockstar are just greedy with money... if want to waste money on sharkcard psh not even worth it... and have fun grinding to making cash. your pretty much just gonna waste most your time and money on cars mostly trust i know played on both PS3/4 and this one.... over 200mil on cars... &gt _&gt sigh.... grinding wasted by getting jew 10/10 would totally buy and greedy jewish game
Please solve the optimization problem !
The game just killed itself in my eyes. first brendan greene calls his fan base racist for supporting a region lock then he goes back on his word and blocks reshade. 3/10 would not recommend
Online isn't even fun and now there's nothing to do in single player. No reason for me to play this game anymore.
I love PUBG. The dev's have only improved it since launch. You will notice a lot of the negative reviews for this game are from people with hundreds of hours of playtime. I think that is a good sign that the negative review is just salty players who obviously enjoyed it otherwise they wouldn't have spent 400+ hours playing it.Edit Another thing people seem to like complaining about Crates. What the do crates have to do with the gameplay? Why are you spending money on crates anyways. Fortnite does all of this too but has half the depth of gameplay as PUBG does.
In its current state probably a 3 1/2 out of 5. The game itself is very enjoyable the problem is with the servers and menus. finding a game takes forever and then if anyone drops out while the match is loading you may as well call it a night 'cause its going to take all day to load. The menus are a bit glitchy and will ocationally freeze requiring a full PC restart to fix.
Honestly in my opinion worth every penny. my first game period. i will not forget everything great about this game But on the other hand you will die a lot there is a steep learning curve and you will not regret the purchase
Really bad game
R.I.P OpenIV
Fun with friends plus you can be an asian.
I spawned not sure on what I was doing...went to a bush and a black man ran at me with a rock! Wasn't sure what to do so i ended up having a naked fight with a black man and a massive !Only issue is the game randomly shuts off after a while and I had jus found my house after dying!!!
I don 't understand you people i brought every console version NOW NO ING MODS WHO THE HELL ARE YOU DOING THIS IS TOTALLY UNJUST UN FAIR TO US YOUR COMSUMERS TAKE TWO YOU A BUNCH OF HATS THIS IS NOT RIGHT..AND I PAID FOR GTA V $60.00 FROM STEAM IM ANGERY AS
Great game at times it can get boring mainly as a solo player like myself but playing with friends is an absolute ball! The modders are ing cancer though
Lovely game great machanics a horror take on hide and seek. Just like the idea you can actually hide in the this game. Love the killers sure some are annoying but survivors are too so it balances. Some bugs that stops you getting into lobbies but a quick restart usually fixes it and they are updating all the time. I'm really loving the killer from horror films being brought into this game and would liek to see others too. Pennywise the clown from IT ? Ghostface from Scream ? So many oppertunities. Really looking forward to what is coming.
This is a must have for every PC gamer.Tons and tons of free DLC and more to come.
Nice Game for premade!!!
I like this game but i have one issues in this game i have missing textures in this game if you know how to fix that add me!
Fun game. There is no game without bugs/cheats but overall is worth it.
Freddy sucks
A lot of hackers/modders in this game. The multiplayer is still super buggy. Overall a pretty good game though.
this game sucks 10/10
It's kinda fun but not really.
you Take 2Mods of life
cant even play most the time because of network lag issues. wont play again until these issuses are fixed. fun game when it actually works
is gud
This is a very enjoyable game. Most of the mechanics are straight forward and exactly how you would image them to be in a game like this. Therefore you can jump right in and start having fun without too much of a learning curve. The game is extremely tactical and a small decision at the beginning of your match could mean death later on. This game thrives when playing in a squad with your friends.Update patches are regular (usually once a week) with hot fixes being deployed right away when needed. I look forward to following this game as it develops.
this game has more problems then any game in history and needs way to much work it may be in early access but it is so early and bad then when i am playing i feel like im beta testing before the game even hits the market. Bottom line you should get paid to play this game not pay to play this game.
well its much better then fortnite and much more real
Very worth game
"10/10 All my friends now know that ""F"" Honks the horn."
This is a awesome game after buying it i cant stop playing it. Especially online. But the servers are a bit crap. They sometimes stop for no reason and everybody leaves. adn this happens even when i am in a heist. otherwise its a good game
A good game !Often updated and getting better and better.
This game is good you have to learn how to play it though because at first its confusing
Alright for all of you that give this game a bad review. Shut up. I've looked through these reviews for a little bit now and they are all about the same thing. Stream sniping and streamer harrassment. Yes it is possible to do these things and yes you should be banned from CHEATING. Streamers make games become popular a majority of the time. If you don't want to get banned don't intentionally stream snipe or harrass the streamers. Secondly this game is amazing. It's in alpha so I know that there will be problems and issues but the devs are working hard to fix these issues and make this game complete. Even with random bugs and whatnot this game still managed to sell 8 MILLION copies. That alone tells you that this game is fantastic. The satifaction from kills feels so good and winning feels even better. I personally even if I don't win the round feel accomplished if I take out several people a game. Thirdly micro transactions are just a thing of games. Sure the devs said there wouldn't be any. Fair point there. BUT you don't have to buy anything other then the game to play. Also it's not like you need to spend money on the crates in order to do better or win more. It's only cosmetic rewards which have no influence on the game itself. I personally think that making microtransactions on a game this popular is a great move for the company Blue Hole. Of course they are going to want to make more money on a game. Can you really blame them?!Alright I've ranted a little bit about why people are giving this bad reviews and I hope you look at my review and understand that it is all avoidable. If you don't want to get banned don't stream snipe or be an to streamers (a stable in the coommunity). If you don't like micro transactions don't buy them. If you want to have fun play this game with a few friends and enjoy what Player Unknown has created and have a great time!See you all in the Battlegrounds!
Best mlg game of the year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! D
fun and e x h i l a r a t i n g STRESSFUL at the same time. Skill ceiling is much too high for me as I die every game without a single kill but I'm probably just a ing scrub and need to GIT GUD.
This game gets my adrenaline pumping far more often than any other game I own. While playing I have come across so many instances where crapping oneself is entirely possible with the unlimited potential of ambushes and unmitigated wafare.10/10 would recommend to anyone I speak to ever.
Rocket League is life.
You can kill Prostitutes
Amazing game. 2v2 &lt 3 vroom vroom
Flying cars hitting big bouncy balls what more can be said.
Epic
This game was very enjoyable until about a week ago it seems that china in overtakin the north american servers. also the amout of hackers that i have been killed by in the past week is unbearable and it was like this until china comes to our srevers .
Hackers invisible people horrible controls boring as hell and completely unfair to new players. The reason i say it is completely unfair to new players is that there is no practice mode or level system so your just thrown into matches with people who have 2 hours or 2000 hours in PUBG. i find it hard to learn a game when im constantly dying before i can even get a chance to fight back. Hit boxes are also a large problem where bullets will just fly through someone because the game decided not to register that headshot costing your your first win. Im tried of playing this broken peice of game and i hope this game is a complete failure in the coming years
hacker everywhere
Needs more mods. the only good thing to come from T2 is that they shut down the most infamous cheating menu. But then you wonder why did it take this long? That menu required a $260 year long subscription has this not ever bothered them before? I also agree that the DLC updates have always been overpriced. More than likely T2 forcing rockstar to nickel and dime the players.
korean language surpport please!!!!
9/10 Have a blast freeroaming through SAN ANDREAS!

ONE FRASE TO RESUME THIS GAME FOR ME LATELY BAD MODULE INFO CRASH. THIS GAME WILL CRASH AFTER MATCHMAKING START BUTTON IS FIRED. AND ON OFFICIAL FORUM THE CHANNEL SUPPORTS DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IS HAPPENING (AND ALSO AT THE OFFICIAL TWITTER SUPPORT). THIS ISSUES OCCURS AFTER LASTS UPDATES AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM IS GROWING MORE AND MORE. AND OFTEN WITH WINDOWS 10 LAST UPDATES. I THINK THAT PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL WINDOWS 10 INSTALLED OR THEY IS NOT UPDATING IT ANY WAY.
A unique little competitive game. Has great music and visuals as well as gameplay.
Product received for free. Good
Product received for free. Nice game !
Wish I didn't buy this game it's fun at first then gets boring very fast if you sit in a building and play safe the entire time it's an easy win Most servers have insane Lag gotta pick up ammo 4 times and then load your gun 3 times overall it's not worth buying because you will quickly get bored of Tyler Perry's battlegrounds aka a ing joke of a game
I just wanted to be a rebel
unless your pc/laptop is optimised to play triple A games you gotta run this thing on lowest setting to get a decent fps granted is early access so you will be expecting lags bugs server connection errors battle F**king eye wont let you start the game and oh yer we have paid cosmetics now so thats cool but wait you had this on recommend? alright anyone who has a heart problem dont bother because is the last ten scenario we camp and fight for when your heart is pumping over 200 bpm and your hands is already stink with sweat atlast you get that long awaited chicken dinner and you feel..... empty so you decided to go outside and get that three piece box from kfc for 12.99 with a stamdard drink.(paid sponsor by KFC Australia)
banned modding for this game great... EDITOPENIV IS BACK
I loved playing this before the social justice update but... Now I see people complaining about bad performance from updates too? None of my friends are playing with it in this condition. This a n t iharrassment system that enables more of what it is trying to prevent is stupid and shouldn't exist. Online Bans are supposed to be for foulplay cheaters and hackers not for protecting your safe space. For unsportsman like play or chat griefing I feel if it is actually the programmers responsibility to protect you from negative online interactions to that extent it should only be through utilities like individualized blocklists or blacklisted matchmaking servers for rude uncooperative or frequent afk players to play amongst themselves. It's unreasonable to revoke service without breaking any agreed terms and I did not see my fellow players permanent happy mentality in the ToS. I literally haven't played ANY randoms or used any crate keys since they added bans because I feel anxious that BS would happen to me. Simply because matchmaking is such random unbalanced crap unfair games are not fun and leave children salty and report happy.. If that happens to me I will likely never play again period. In the mean time I feel better leaving it alone permanently of my own volition and only playing IF friends I know who won't do that EVER play again. So far no luck..
This game started out pretty fun and has the potential to be. However what it has boiled down to are griefers running around destroying your bases and killing your dinos for lols. This wouldn't be an issue if it was more difficult to destroy something than it is to build it however it is so laughably easy to offline raid a base that there is no point in even attempting to build anything unless you are in a mega tribe with 20 players. Not to even mention that troll builds have players sprinting around at insane speeds with the ability to knock you out in one hit with a wooden club regardless of your armor. The community has just gotten more and more toxic since release.TLDR Game is full of griefers and promotes griefing by design. Stay away.
It is a very good game. But it isnt recomended for people that rages a lot and quickly gets mad. Very fun btw
I bought this for the mods and now I can't even get mods on it anymore?? Erm?
Fix low fps
Not good enough guys. The kids wanna mod. 354/10 for customer service
"We're but quote ""wood to be chopped"" for the devs and publishers."
"After Almost 100hours And 3 Solo Wins...This game will you off its that simple. Buy yet after every annoying death or almost wins i keep playing.After every match my heart is usually pumping. Which is a very addicting feeling. No matter what when you drop in with a 100 other people to fight it out. No matter who you are you have a chance. A tiny little sliver of a chance to win. Knowing that the games incredibly fun. Some Advice For New Players Luck Is a big part of it. Dropping in and finding good gear quickly and arming yourself with the best weapons as fast as possible is the ""Meta"" of this game. Inventory management and quickly tabbing in and out and using drag and drop to pick up weapons and gear is CRUCIAL. The Faster you do this the longer you will surivive. It takes time but youll get good at it I will say this is a game of choosing your battles planning out a strategy and being able to adjust to what the game throws at you. If you can overcome all those things and add a little proper marksmenship and i gurantee youll get a win. In terms of any negatives It's Early Access Theres gunna be server issues glitches alot of things that still need to be ironed out. But nothing game breaking. (Just expect it to happen) The Bullet Drop seems a little extreme to me. To hit a moving target 200 300 meters away you have to aim almost 5 feet in front of your target. When i feel like in most games and realisticly aiming for the bodys leading edge would do the trick. Now Ive played almost every battlefield ARMA 2 &amp 3. Im quite familair with extreme and realistic bullet drop in games. Honestly getting used to the bullet drop is what drew me away from the game about 27ish hours in. I just couldent hit anybody at range. Then finally it clicked. It took me quite awhile to get used to the gun play and finallly now around 80 hours in i can almost gaurantee ill make it to the top 5 at least. So at least for me i had a steep learning curve. In Conclusion In the end i feel like PUBG is a solid shooter once you learn its quirks and get used to the gunplay. I can easily say ive had more tense moments and smiles per hour playing this than any other game in years."
Toxicity worst than cs 10/10
Bring back Mods...
Still waiting for 1.0 but a nice fps game.
Great Game10/10 Just don't waste your money on shark cards
No just...no.
Pretty neat game well worth looking into if oyu enjoy some crafting base building survival and mmo type games.
GG
Always a blast to play either alone or with a group of friends!
I haven't played it that much after I initially bought it. It was decent.However banning mods and modders is a great way to kill your community and all respect. This is my protest review.Enjoy you greedy neophytes.
Too many Asians atm. Can't communicate with team. Not racist.
The game runs poorly low fps much lags low fun .Dont buy yet maybe in a few months...If they can fix the performance issues this could be a real fun game though!
very ez
anlatmaya gerek yok görüyorsunuz Dgüzel bi oyun ama arkadaşınız olmadan biraz sıkıcı olabiliyor xd

Haven't been outside in years cuz of this game.
This is complete trash buy a disc copy. the steam drm sucks you have to be have internet just to play had i known that i wouldnt have bought it from Steam
"Game has cosmetics that have worse odds of unlocking then winning the lottery. On top of this the community has made several suggestions few of which have been implemented. It fees like the devs stopped caring because they got popular and started making alot of money. This game in the end is only slightly better then fortnite and that says ALOT considering how that cesspool of a ""game"" is."
This game became cs go now you have to buy skins or don't play it.. Try mobile version if you really like the idea of pubg
If you like to wind up friends and dance whilst they fight a hard tier Monster this is the game for you.
gudluk )
Pretty much decent
"The standard edition looks better with the mods available. And isn't restricted. And doesn't make you buy 15 bucks worth of microtransactions to get a ""Survival Mode"". hey at least it's got ***GOD RAYS*** OOOOOO AMAZING TEN OUT OF TEN."
best community
Take two (owns rockstar) RUINED the online experience by ruining the game economy. I shouldnt have to spend an extra $100 on top of a $60 game to enjoy only very little of the online content. This isnt CSGO where youre only paying for skins. For gta its pay to play then you just pay and pay moreTLDR unless you're bill gates dont buy this

Good game. First of many BR games and still one of the best.
I have to rate this game as positive because I really do enjoy it a lot. But I would say if you get annoyed easily steer clear until the multiplayer actually works )
Easy to learn hard to master
good

Great game but uses DENUVO. So thumbs down.
Product received for free. Nice Game
Product received for free. Really good game addictive. Although the match is 5min you can spend hours in the game.
love this game but hackers are everywhere. and please region lock china
Impossible not to recommend i only took upon myself to write the reviem after the PC 1.0 launch i did so because i believe that before an official launch the game should be played with an open mind for future developments. After PC 1.0 Launch Lagging reduced significantly in the first minute of a game.Renderization problems for people with not such a high end pc fixed.Official second map.Jumping walls.There isnt anything to say about the game that hasnt been said before all i can do is guarantee this game is worth playing!
Great game great single player. Problem is the ompany that owns it is money grubbing and exploitative with microtransactions in multiplayer and possibly even getting rid of modding.Good for a mobile game i suppose.
gameplay 10/10 online servers 10/10
i love dead by daylight its a fun horror game where you can either play as a survivor and escape the grasp of the killer or you can be the killer and run around grab survivors and then hook them. Loved It 10/10
They dun goofed. Finebros no.2
A great game that you don't easily get bored ofPros +Incredibly fun.+Lots of cars and customization options to choose from.+Many modes.+Great singleplayer.+Good graphics.+Easy to play.+Lots of UpdatesCons +Some issues related to internet and ping but that's only in my area.+Can't play with a specific player on another platform unless you create a private match.Overall a truly amazing game and definately worth your money.9/10

Found people online. 10/17
This game used to be good but they ruined oce servers
Optimized with a toaster! Laggy servers glitchs everywhere a 14yold mods team and a total crap of interface! This game would be sold for 4.90 or bundled with other amateur indies.OH and now.... MICROTRANSACTIONS!!!! BEST LIAR EVERUpdate Now more trash than before!Update Trasher than ever!
I think the game is allrigth but there are some things like hitboxes blocking the bullet or guns doing very low damage. Also soundworld could need some fixes...
A fun game if you like survival and pvp + pve if you want on servers. Its very fun if you have people to play with and the servers are fun too i guess... Get it for survival in a harsh enviroment with good elements 8/10. Nudity is involved but can be turned off
THis game is dont try it plz uninstall buggy piece of ing trash ing garbage dont even ing touch this crashing mother ing garbagecan ing trash.
Honestly endless hours of fun. Never seems to get boring because the map is really big and the people aren't too difficult. Once you get all the controls settled down it is a really fun and addicting game
Was a funny trash now it is not a funny but still trash.
Amazing! love this game and I have made so many new friends from it!DEFINITLY GET THIS GAME!!! #$%!!
Overall the game is good I love the unique concept about it. it's a battle royale yes. But still there's something different about it than H1Z1 ARMA 3. Also fun to play in squads and duos.Got a custom match system that anyone can use.Now for the bad stuff PThe game is very poorly optimized most people don't get more than 45 50 FPS on regular areas.The loot system is ed up you can go inside 5 houses and barely get a pistol and backpack. Also the servers seem to be unstable and have constant lags.
copied overwatch

One of the best survival games I have ever played. Devs are very active which is great lots of new content almost every week!I recommend Rust for anyone that loves survival games.
The game where you fight monsters and your character starts swinging in the opposite direction of the monster and you faint then takes 5 years to recover from a monster roar.
Run around with naked people. What's not to like ??
Product received for free. Don't know what on earth this is but from the looks of it and the discussion threads I'm not in for a good experience.
you steal cars and stuff
GTA 5 is the best for all consoles
trash game
Does not show servers and sometimes does not load the game in. Tried everything in the forums and nothing works.
amazing game ruined by ing hackers.. never have I seen a game with this many hackers... amazing game infested by virgin hackers that can die in hell.
over all a waste of money way better games out here to spend your money on like ark or just survive. It was very disapointing real hard to find food you end up starving. I will Not be comming back to this game.
The latest installment in the Grand Theft Auto series is a great one I have had hours of fun with this game and will continue to play from hours on end I'm not going to touch the online issues that R* is causing but besides all of that bs this is a really great game and if you have the money and you can run it you should buy it.
Bug bug bugity bug. Crash lag DC fps drop bug. Servers are down. Reconnect to the game lobby
game always crash 0/10
Bought it 3 times played it 3 times regreted 2 times that sums up GTA
Don't get attached to anything you find or create. It will be destroyed! 10/10
it says play this weekend and get 750 000 and i havent got anything at all /
I recommend this game but this servers are crap.Fix this bugs and PUT MORE SERVERS PLZ
Why even bother having a co op system if its this ing br&gt and the optimization from console to pc.Game still has a ton of problems as a port but its pretty fun as a game. Would recommend once they get the port optimized and ironout the issues
it really FUN and i enjoy it
really good game!!!
VeRrY FuN GaMe
Love This Game Shooting player while Driving + listening songs But i only hate 1 things is ( Fortunate Son ) song didn't add to GTA FM
they bought all ingame assets from the unreal store stopped updating the game weekly performance gets worse and worse. no communication at all. ingame ads in asia. microtransactions and loot crates during early access.also fortnite is much better and more fun and its free. dont pay 30 dollars for this game.
Fun game especially with friends. With randoms though? Watch the madness unfold. You can carry a game 5 0 and watch your advantage crumble because your team mates will try to goal steal they'll up the shot and when it's time to def they can't do all. In the end you lose 5 6 and have a german kid in your team with 0 goals and 0 saves rage at you saying you ed up the game.10/10 would recommend.
Product received for free. This Game Neeed OP PC !But its GooD Game For People who love survival games !!
I can run the game most of the time with 70 100 FPS (not in the big cities) My Specs Ryzen 7 2700xRAM 16GBGTX1060 6GBCons poor EU server bad optimized end circles are too fast desync is the most anyoing thing ever and makes the game feel like sh** not enough Loot Pro + Shooting and Gunplay+ The Dev Team are Working hard
Very addicting game with many minigames. Great purchase!!!
varios bugs e nenhuma correção!
good game
This is actually a beatiful game I have barely encountered any glitches I love this game I adore it I look forward to the progress this game makes and I look forward to everything this game has to offer.
I'd say this game is good but as all games it has its downsides. The games servers are not the best in the world and will probably screw you over every once in a while but overall a good game.

Great game. Fun to play with others boring alone.
very good game i like a lot
Amazing game straight up. I only am writing this review for the first time to the disagreement of the other reviews having problems with it so far.I don't know what's up with their internet or PC but the game works fine. Not Perfect because Yes even I had trouble coming to the Error 50382 MW1 but I assure you it does work if you put just a tad bit effort in like creating a new session or whatever.This is by no means a bad game because It's Monster Hunter that originally was supposed to played on PS4 not PCI don't know if you truly expected a PC Port to be 100% Perfect from a company that already puts so much effort into a beloved series and has NEVER done a PC release like this. I'm completely baffled by the amount of ignorance and hatred it gets that gets sent because of it.Give it time and it will work. There will be hiccups sure. But it has worked for me. They've never placed Monster Hunter on a PC so you gotta give em respect for atleast trying to do their research hence the long 7 months it took for it to release. And I have never lost faith in a Monster Hunter game. It's my all time favorite Series since Freedom Unite and I HIGHLY recommend this game to you and friends.Seriously if a friend can play it and connect to sessions on a potato of a laptop and internet. I'm very sure there's not much excuse here. All I'm asking is that you can wait a bit longer or play the game cause it deserves to be played and respected as a GOOD game.
Remember To Turn Off Your Cell Phones And Please Don t Masturbate. Still waiting for this Public Service Announcement to play at my movie theatre

"I was playing with my best friend and his ""battle Buddie."" We found a motorcycle with a sidecar as the safe zone was closing. I gave up my life so these two US Army Soldiers could live on. I found out minutes later that the motor cycle seats three...10/10 would commit suicide without real need again"
Its a good game killer of H1Z1 but its laggy needs work

This game is what a 40k game should be like. It manages to capture the feeling and aesthetics of that universe unlike any other game before it.Its a good space strategy game too the music is a blast and the graphics are nice and shiny.Buy this now that Dawn of War is gone we need a new series to pick up the 40k torch and I for one would be happy to see this series doing it.
story mode 10/10online 1/10
150 hours of getting chased in a circle and then dropping a pallet on some tall retard with an axe4/10 devs barely care enough to add content let alone run their customer service
