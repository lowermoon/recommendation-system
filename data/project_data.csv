joki Destiny,Recommended for all gamers.Fun and addictive best to play with friends. Pros Customizable cars. Unlockable customizables. Variety of maps. Variety of settings you don't have to just play a regular game you can change gravity ball weight ball shape etc. Good soundtrack could use more but not complaining. Keeps you busy for hours. Awesome DLCs.Cons I believe they made it so you can only get some drops if you play online matches rough for those who dislike playing online. Playing online tends to force you to turn your graphics quality basically all the way down depending where you connect. The AI sucks when starting out on Rookie. They tend to score on their own goal. Extremely funny nonetheless.,suhu

joki Minecraft,I LOVE THIS IN GAME!!!!!,"gg, wibu"
tutor Minecraft,Amazing so far. Great sequel to the series and finally on PC. Running on a GTX 760 at 1440p. 4k looks nice but FPS drops to below 30. Buttery smooth 1440p.Radio is very entertaining. The map has definitely changed alot since San Andreas but there are still some areas that are very close and reminicent of the older game. Cars handle alot better than GTA IV. Switching between characters isn't as bad as I thought it would be. I'm also a big fan of how the map is not locked down from the beginning such as all the other GTA games. First thing I did after the prologue was boost a car drive to the airport and grabbed the first plane I found and cruised around the map (dat turbulence). Love this game so far. Only played online for a few minutes and hit rank 3. Lots of potential and really looking forward to continuing this game. 10/10.,"cecan, cogan"

Spawn into a busy area and kill as many people as possible in a short space of time OR spawn in a quiet area get lots of loot and try and kill mid to late gameCons No tutorial this game will throw you in at the deep end. Some patience is needed to begin with. Don't expect to spawn as a godCommunity can be either hilarious or highly offensiveAlthough only playing for a short time there has been downtime to servers minimal thoughHigh skill cap at times if you don't enjoy losing sometimes... don't buy the game!Graphics not optimisedAll in all I really enjoy this game so far and I'm sure with the coming updates that get added regularly it will only improve.

You can always go to console and type nudity.censor true (Or False if you wanna see If you are someone who gives up easily I would not recommend this game for you.

tutor Genshin Impact,Great game to play with friends Few things still need work but seems like it is close to release now. Never had any crashes however the game does lag on the start up menu (which seems like it crashes) however if you leave it it will open just fine. Also isnt really the best optimised with my 970 I struggle to keep 60fps on med high settings at 1080p However this seems to be something in common with alot of similar survival games such as ARK.Overall I think this is a great buy at 15 even better if you get it on sale for around 10.

joki FF,"Honestly this game must host some of the clunkiest combat I have witnessed. You cant jump unless you sprint towards a cliff or unless you use a certain weapon type and even then it is ridiculously hard to control your character when in the air. I have lost count at the amount of times they just flail around and miss the enemy. This brings us to another major issue of this game the lock on system. Most of the enemies in the game will have ""weak spots"" on their bodies but you can only lock on to 2 parts the body and the head. This makes it really hard to hit the weakspots or even the enemy alot of the time because your character will just kind of attack in a direction and when using dual blades for example will fly right by the enemy not even hitting it. It is quite comedic at how bad the combat is. Often times when fighting the larger monsters another larger monster will come around and join the fight. To change the enemy you are locked onto you have to cycle through all the targets in the area swaying the camera around most likely ending with you being cheap shotted and at higher levels this could end up with you being on shotted. Furthermore I like the idea of enemies fighting one another but it is so poorly implemented in this game that they attack eachother maybe once then they will turn and beeline it for the player characters. To add onto this there is no blood or healthbar for enemies so you will be fighting monsters until you can visibly see them limp when they run away which seems like it can take and eternity. Even when they are limping it still takes quite some time to actually finish them off. This seems like a major missed opportunity to actually have the enemies show blood cuts and bruises to signify the health they have left. Even if the gore was an option in the menu it would have been a welcome addition.The ""hunting"" in this game is honestly the most monotonous part. You fight a monster it runs away you chase after it you fight it it runs away you chase after it rinse and repeat. This can occur maybe like 6 12 times for a single monster. It may seem refreshing at first but after the first 10 hours it gets annoying and fairly rage inducing especially because that is a good portion of the ""gameplay"". And honestly it could be forgivable if the combat wasn't so terrible.Also a good portion of the enemies you fight in this game can become airborne meaning if you have a melee weapon (which I assume alot of the playerbase will) you either have to wait for it to land or get a few lucky hits on its feet as it hovers just above your head. This just adds to the monotony and could have been fixed if you were able to equip a ranged weapon as well as a melee weapon OR even easier be able to jump without having a cliff nearby... or even better both?The progression in this game is entirely hit and miss as well. You grind for hours on end to get better armor and weapons (in a pretty impressive technology tree) but you never actually feel like you can kill monsters faster more efficiently or take less damage from them. You get to a certain point in the game where you may start to feel progression and then the enemies get alot harder dropping better materials to further farm but basically kill you in one or two hits. You have to farm for better armor to not get one shotted but the enemies you have to farm are the culprits of this unfair challenge. It honestly all just feels like artificial challenge especially with how awful the hitboxes are as well. There were countless times playing this game where I visibly was beside underneath or behind the enemy when they attacked and even though there was no physical way I could have gotten hit I indeed lost health and most likely got stunned leaving me open to another attack. It's kind of funny how the same company that made this game also made Dragon's Dogma which featured better controls and in my honest opinion significantly better combat. You can jump and grapple enemies regardless of the weapon you have equipped and you can dodge out of an attack providing much more responsive combat in a game released years before this one. The game got fairly monotonous as the hours started to add up and honestly a good portion of the ""difficulty"" I encountered felt artificial due to the gameplay mechanics. If the combat was ironed out and the hitboxes fixed the game would honestly be pretty fun. But as of right now if you're feeling like wasting your time to chase monsters countless times each ""hunt"" for 15+ minutes over and over again with some pretty rage inducing combat this game may be for you.","pro player, sepuh, suhu"

This is my honest feeling about the game.Solo Can be challenging You either die within the first 30sec or you end up killing some poor soul that is trying to enjoy the game but you ended up gunning him down anyways. So you made it past the first 2 min gun shots are popping off near you. People do one or two things.. 1) Aggressive player Follows the gun shots and attemps to kill everyone around ( About 15% of the people who try this can do it) 2) House Keeping The guy that waits till gun shots stop and goes in to clean the guy looting .. (Enough said with that one) Now at this point you are either in the Zone or Driving/Running to the Zone.. Those Driving or running 50% end up getting shot and killed. The other 50% make it to the middle of the zone camp in a house or are out looking for kills.After flipping your car.. Running a guy down Gunning someone down.. you are in the Top 10 and either you get picked out by a sniper or fragged... RIP... Chicken Dinner !! You won your first game.. Congrats.. you got 1kill ... Duo You cannot go wrong with Duo's .. The amount of enjoyment in duo is legit over 9000!! You guys play together calling shots kill everyone the millitary base! Load out with Silence M4 lvl 3 gear Both got a Kar98 8x Silenced man! life is good! Bang bang! you guys killing it both got 9 kills each reaching the end of the zone! Chicken Dinner.. EZPZ if you got a good friend or team8 its legit amazing!! ORYall s*** and ... well you know you made it half way but didnt win.. Don't worry keep at it legit everyone can get a win... okay not everyone..Squad Where do you start man... its so fun! gun shots everywhere 4 squads landing at the same spot! granades flying Bullets Smokes Beating people down with your fist or a PAN!! amazing. You got that one guy on your team.. he doesnt know how to drive so gets all you killed!! Then you make it and there is people already camping the middle of the circle! your team rolls up and just get's LIT UP! no return.. lol.. OR you and your friends actually good and take them out! ... Either way you guys are going to have so much fun.. But sometimes you got that one guy in your team and you guys are on discord flaming each other ... lul ( We do this all the time) But legit fun!I have shot a guy mid air with a Kar98 while he was doing a flip on a bike.. I have also shot a guy inside the 5th seat aiming down the bridge (fkn bridge campers) with a K98 + 8x while car moving!Legit I flipped crashed into a tree blew up my 4man squad.. Had my Retardo team8 shot our team8 while he was down begging for help.. lmao.. ( After he killed him"" DUDE! i didnt know that was you!) Back flipping on a bike with your friend! Landing on a roof top! Done that! had a 8 man fist fight! its an experience ...Hacker's In all my hours on PUBG ( I only play NA) I have encounter i want to say 10 ? maybe less than 15 hackers.. I can't speak for all regions but NA I haven't seen a lot. Although.. its really annoying when you do get killed by one.This is my opinion on the game. I have had a lot of fun and a lot of games.. but you know it happens. I have gotten a lot better &amp I plan on enjoying the rest of the game. See you guys on 1.0 ! (sorry for my spelling mistakes I did see a few of them but honestly im sittinng here watching netflix at 1 30ish AM and I am not about to go back an correct them... Sorry lmao.

Where has the weather gone? it was fun when it might be raining or foggy and make the game more challeneging yeha it would you off to get sniped in the fog but it would also be funny and the dicersity was great. 2. Hackers...... seraiously do something about them please!......maybe impose region locks....3. The emotes and stuff just why te pose no purpose. BE PUBG NOT FORTNITE. 4. You' really went and introduced keys and creatws didn't you. This isn't no CSGO bull this is PUBG you added the microtransactions for nothing! Weapon skins really? Making a random create dropper instead of the free one for people is a move man.Bottom Line i still like pubg but its loseing its identity its become a csgo foortnite instead of focusing on making its own chracter. People aready baught the game now you're gonna charge us to unlock creates? Mate off. Don't become greedy s like EA when you have a good game going.

joki Destiny,Well the concept is good but the game is not confusing as hell and poorly constructed. Now i dont have much time in the game because its hard to get into theres no map very glitchy and laggy (and its not my computer i have a 2014 alienware mx17). Also the resources (other than wood) are SUPER hard to find. I have played 1.5 hours so far and have yet to find stone/ores its impossible. Many feel the same via chat. RECCOMENDATION TO THE MAKERS Please please please add a map for starters first thing hands down next make resources easier to find and mabey even a different color than the mountain of boulders. The game is just to hard in the beggining very frustrating and discouraging. Lag and glitches seem to be the norm so mabey limit the amount of players in a server and reduce some detail. My setting is on fastest and its still horrible. In conclusion i think you have a great idea and i do reccomend the game based on the vision but as far as were is stands now I do not reccomend to people this game at its current stage it definatly is not worth $20 as it is.,"valorant, mobile legend"

joki Destiny,Excellent entry to the Monster Hunter series. Has a few technical issues but gameplay is so good I've taken to calling it Quality of Life Hunter.Pros +Its monster hunter that means boss fights to turn dinosaurs into armor and weapons to fight bigger dinosaurs+excellent combat system+Graphics are great if your rig can handle it+plethora of graphics options if you can't+many QoL items that were a drag for previous installments have been eliminated or streamlined+fun and varied monster fights+EXCELLENT Environments with interactables and destructables galore+they will be adding more monsters (look at what consoles got for an idea theres no official roadmap)Cons very system resource intensive. AMD systems got a better run of it especially since the newest Nvidia drivers dont play nice. Story is lackluster (but who cares thats not why you buy a monster hunter game) Constant connection issues with multiplayer (although there is talk of patching this it does get annoying) no native steam controller support but it works fine for xbox configs relatively small monster list compared to other MH games (30 something vs 90 something from 4u and gen but who knows maybe theyll add that many),"cecan, wibu"

joki Resident Evil,"i was stupid for buyng this game specially the criminal starter pack.the offline part is fine and a good game but all online experience is horrendous.Its basically a cashgrab even with the so called ""starterpack"" that IS BASICALLY A PAYWALL.. let me give an exemple you get ""for free"" a company and can act as CEO but to get it actually running you need to spend extra to buy a warehouse just to BEGIN playing a mission. after you begin finnaly playing it.... oh wait it was a setup mission not an actual mission then you get killed over and over by other online players higher leveled than you since they get rewarded for killing you and taking all you worked for. even if you do magically do this you still need to redo this mission ( driving a slow boring car for 10 km ) dozens of time just to break even in in game currencyim sure it was a thrill playing this back when it launched but if you want this game just buy a phisical copy for literally zero dollars and play offline.i wish i hadnt played offline first so i could apply for a refund","gg, sepuh"

joki Minecraft,I love this game and I wanted to grind it out quite hard after waiting more than two weeks for the release however I came to a huge dissapointment.After buying it straight when it came out I couldn't run the game at all and I still can't after some time of waiting for the optimisation patch or something like that. After going through pretty much every post on the forum and tutorials on youtube how to max out the performance of this unoptimised I give up. The minimum system requirements are a total lie and only the best rigs can run it fine... It's a shame but I will still wait for the patch because I really enjoy watching the game and I would be even more pleased if I could actually play it. For 27 I expected much better. As I said there is nothing wrong with the game itself it's just the performance and optimisation section which made me not recommend this game at the current time. After some months I will revisit this game and do another review of this to see if anything changes.UPDATE After the optimisation update and buying new RAM I have little to no problem of running the game.,"jodoh, susah, cecan"
joki Bang Bang,The game itself is pretty fun but they've recently destroyed the modding community for both online and offline play. The new content they add is only accessible online which wouldn't be the worst thing ever but it is locked behind insane prices that would require hours of tedious grinding if you wanted to gather up enough funds. ...or you know you can buy Sharkcards and get a fraction of the content that they put out. For $100 you would get 8 million in game currency which won't even get you very far. You might be able to get a few of the vehicles or the special facilities that they seem to keep locking content behind. To put things into perspective 8 million in game currency isn't even enough to buy the most expensive yacht in the game and the yachts don't really even do that much for you. So Rockstar seems to think that their virtual yacht (you can't even drive it) is worth over 100 dollars.,gg

They let hackers run free ban legit players and BAN the moding which actually gave a fresh breath in the singleplayer since their focus is on ONLINE which you have to spend large ammount of time griding or buy shark cards to get more useless stuff..Now T2 is shutting down modding...P.s. forgot to mention they raised the price before the sale/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Well more than a year has passed for this game on PC *Alot more was added like freemode events stunt series &amp tons of cars.*Alot less hackers than before there are some but no obvious hacker insanity cluster like before.*People alot less lively nobody speaks that much via microphone no more but servers are always populated.*Heists are harder to complete because not many want to waste time and patience for them since they can farm freemode and other events*Missions &amp heists still have long loading times (thank god for free mode events)*Heist leavers are unpunished there is no way to just go back and find one player after someone leaves you are just thrown back into free mode again and have to invite everyone again which is pain in the and time consuming*Last heist (pacific bank) is abused with kuruma which makes things too easy and people still fail*Online mode is less lively some of the pedestrians missing in certain places no wildlife some aircrafts/vehicles are gated or not available online*Some car upgrades are unlocked by winning races.. And i don't mean top 3 or anything you have to finish first which is hard if you're matched up with players of same skill so many people abuse it by purposely losing races for each other*Upgrades cost more than in singleplayer. And sometimes you get unreasonable fees fixing the car from a small bump*Vip work and CEO organisation work gave mayhem some kind of purpose*Highly customisable cars (benny's) upgrades costs alot so you either farm cash or buy shark cards(don't buy shark cards)*Yachts are basically static waste of money with few mini events and cost alot so Rockstar really wants you to buy shark cards. Basically your e p*nis..*No more content for singleplayer (sad)*Kuruma still has insurance for some reason. I mean come on if someone gangs up on you with it it's damn hard to kill them without blowing up the car and paying their insurance.*Weapon wheel is a mess. You have to cycle through all of the weapon types and cannot remove certain weapons so it makes it harder to fight sometimes*Major shuttering issues are fixed although there some texture popping issues specialy on windows 10*For some reason Online works worse then singleplayer with shutters texture pop ins and other weird stuff*Input lag. Sometime this thing happens out of nowhere.*Community is kind of toxic but that is expected for this satire game. Even the game is built in such way so people could screw over each other so expect players talking respawn camping you chasing all over the map just for killing them that one times or bumping into their vehicle*Customer support is non existent you have better luck searching the forums for help from other players or googling going on youtube to find solutions for your issues.This game is worth it's price even for just it's singleplayer witch is about 30 50 hours depending on your playstyle . Story is weaker than IV's in my opinion but still awesome.

It takes 70 hours to pass single part yes. But it still feels small and toneless. I never liked GTA SA and GTA4 but they are totaly better in a story part. Yes 5th part full of optional things to do. But you won't do them all. Skyfalls and all that internet stuff and etc. will become boring after 3 times Cinemas too. What else? Side missions are good.

Instead of fixing the myriad of issues like bad hit registration poor optimization inconsistent early game loadins etc. they continue to try and push paid updates on their player base. I don't want loot crates or paid event passes I want a game that ing works since it's been out of early access for over 6 months. For a company that's made almost a billion dollars in sales you'd think they'd have their priorities straight and put out a decent product. I honestly can't wait for the next BR game to come out that does the hyper realistic style even moderately well because then this game will die as it deserves to since the developers just care about money not a consistent player experience.,"jodoh, suhu, cecan"

The competative levels are great and well matched most of the time. The cars are great although i think the hitboxes need to be alittle smaller to where it is about the same size as the car and not larger than it but this is a rant on their banning system. In the past 2 weeks ive been banned 3 times. Two of them are from saying the ""F word "" multiple times in 1 game and then the third time i got banned was for telling an opposing player to stop telling his teamate that he was trash and to stop calling him bad names because his teamate after all was doing way better than him. i did not curse. I did not use any verbal terms that could hurt ones feelings i didnt even come close to saying stupid or butthead. BUT LORD HELP ME IM THE ONE TO GET BANNED FOR 72 F***ING HOURS FOR NOT EVEN SAYING ANYTHING BAD.

cari DOTA,This Is a great game great idea... except for connection issues. every other game I own runs just fine online but when it comes to puk bg it just has so many issues when trying to enter the game I have great internet and a solid personally built compuer but no mater what there are issues when trying to enter the game initially or trying to enter a match Ive had things happen where it just freezes on the loading screan until im almost hitting the ground and habe thenworst position to not loading at all then theres the issue that once you land the buildings do not load despite the map never changing I've owned the game for three or four months and still no changes it only gets worse it actually ran better when it first came out. this game is not worth the money they are charging for it anymore and with the money they have made you would think they would have improved on this but alas there seems to be no hope for improvement. I'm just about done with dealing with it. not worth the money there are plenty of games similar that you can get that don't have these issues and have other game modes.,"cecan, jodoh"

tutor DOTA,"So the game is okay I think Civ 5 AND 4 were better so I would recommend those over this. That the previous games did things ""better"" is of course personal opinion yet there is another reason I would not recommend this.There is a disturbing attempt to change a personally owned game into the new ""Games as a service"" by forcing an updated user agreement that did not exist at the launch of the game and if you like having your files personal or dont want to agree to give them the information they want then you cant play the game anymore. Thats a very shady move. To think that all they need to do to take away ownership or how you play a game no matter how old the game is is just to update a new user agreement.That would be like Nintendo in the 80's locking a NES copy of Super Mario with radio waves and not letting you play it unless you mailed them a signed letter. The letter saying that you agreed to hand over your address book and photo album if they decided they wanted it in return for letting you play your... ummm actually now its THEIR game.

tutor GTA,Updated Review Game performance has improved both textures and CPU usage. Some area still CPU bottleneck. Connectivity issues have been resolved and random crashes as well. This is a really fun game and now with the additional content will be better. Original Review This game should've stayed a little more time in the oven even more when half of it's issues were present during the console launch.Please do the following Capcom * Remove DRM. It's hogging down CPU performance.* Fix the connectivity issues* Please provide better quality textures.* Please streamline and improve the connection loss and implement a re host/regroup option.* Allow to create an online session from inside a mission. Thanks to the current connectivity errors I have to either finish/abandon a quest so my friends and I can rejoin.To the gamer This game is amazing however there are a lot of problems with it if you're looking into playing co op.

What seems to be a ""throw everyone in an empty world"" simulator it ends up being most appropriately compared to human fecies. We've had alot of fun mostly due to funny bugs and ugly animations. Two hours after joining a server starting with nothing but a stone in your hand and a torch in your bag you feel like you've ""completed the game"". You're now seated in an impenetrable fortress with 30 000 wood in your chest and 10 furnaces running an industrial smelting operation. And you can craft everything in the game.As far as a survival games goes this really is comparable to human fecies animals can't attack you Zombies are removed.

joki PUBG,Astroneer is a terrifically fun game and I really hope the developer continues to produce quality updates for it. It has more content in it as a 'pre alpha' than a lot of early access and beta games that I've played in the past and it's ludicrously simple and fun.Yes there are some issues like crashing (primarily if you're playing multiplayer single player is very stable) and some wonky bugs like very rarely falling through the world when you get out of vehicles. And there's a finite amount of content in the game although there's enough IMO to justify its $20 price tag. There are also some basic features that you'll find in many games like a save management system that just aren't here.But the environments are gorgeous the play mechanics are intuitive and enjoyable (I especially like the fact that there's no UI it really helps with the immersion factor) and the graphics and animations are styilized but fun and beautiful. The fact that there are already multiple planets available (albeit with similar threats and resources available) is great for a game this early in its development.This honestly is what I think No Man's Sky intended to be on a smaller scale but with the potential to achieve what NMS probably won't. If you're into exploration/crafting/survival games I highly recommend picking it up to help out the developers to build this game into something amazing.,"cewek, pro player"

joki VALORANT,After 224 hrs spent on this game I cannot recommend it to anybody. The game is in a very poor state. Most of the issues come from BlueHole's decision to utilize client side processing for practically everything fundamental to this game. Guys with technical know how can come bash me all they want about it but all i know is this. This game is ripe full of hackers and bugs that people exploit and ruin the gaming experience for everybody else almost exclusively due to the client side aspects of this game. For me i could care less about vaulting new maps new guns or graphical updates when the fundamental FPS aspect of this game is soo unwieldy and clumsy. From dying behind cover to out of region desyncers taking 4 5 shots on your screen only to turn around and two shot you. This game finds soo many ways to be completely abysmal even tho the underlying premise of the game has soo much potential. Maybe in the future I'll consider returning to this game when Bluehole decides to be a responsible game developer and focus on fixing current broken fundamental game mechanics instead of pushing out microtransactions superficial updates and claiming this game is ready for the Pro scene.,"jodoh, mobile legend"

cari Resident Evil,"Update 9/5/2017 *Sigh* Extremely buggy and horribly optimized. Honestly if you got AMD you might not want to waste your time. Spend too many hours staring at wikis and tech sites figuring out how to get it to run right. AMD already announced if you have an RX 400 series card don't even use this games msaa causing too many issues. Oh yeah Online is cheater infested as always. If you get this don't buy it for $60 check out those ""other stores""Update 6/18/2017 You killed the community that has kept your games alive since 2001 and even made an online component before you ever did. This is not how a company should treat its fans fans who have even gained real life jobs in game development from testing and practicing safe singleplayer modding in your games. I am highly dissapointed in Take Two Interactive and their CEO Strauss Zelnick. As for Rockstar I know they make the calls not you I just hope at some point Zelnick steps down and somehow this can all be fixed. Probably won't be for years seeing as how much money he has made and even insisted he isn't making as much as he could in an interview. So saddened to see a community that has bonded together since the late 90's fall apart like this. Update 3/19/2017 THIS GAME WILL NOT RUN CORRECTLY FOR ANYONE 8/10 TIMES. YOU WILL FREEZE STUTTER AND SEE THE WHOLE WORLD GO INVISIBLE. DO NOT BUY UNTIL FIXED.Update 12/30/2016 If you are an I5 processor user this game will have massive compatibility issues for you. It won't be unplayable but you will have to drop down to the lowest settings to run it smooth. Wait for a update fix before buying if you are an I5 user.Also there is a new mod menu that is spreading like crazy as the creator made it publicly usable don't know why. Thats why the false claims of ""Rockstar banned me and I did nothing."" are all over the place. So be warned that GTAO is currently modder infested.ORIGINAL REVIEW Odds are you already played this on console. If you liked it then you'll like it now with better graphics and actually above 25fps online. Just watch out for modders most want to mess with u or kill the whole lobby repeatedly with your name attached and get you vote kicked out the lobby. Other than that its a great game. HOWEVER the last update messed up optimization for a lot of people I'm getting way more frame drops and stuttering setting the game to high or realtime priority in task manager did help some but issues still arise.","free fire, susah, gg"

tutor Bang Bang,"OVERALLOversold lie. Rust can be a fun game. It's a community game so most of the dynamics depend on playing with a good community that you agree with. If you want to run in a shoot on sight cut throat server you can find one. If you want to do ""PVE"" for whatever that is you can find a server catered to you. However Rust is definitely geared towards PVP and killing/raiding other people's bases and creating your own. I have some logged hours in which I had fun with friends. This was gifted to me for I personally feel like alpha games now have a bad stigma. THE BAD.Now let's go to the real The creators themselves have stated that they are still trying to find their 'vision' (at the time of this post). They probably have more under wraps that they do not want to reveal but all updates to this point have shown this to be true. Since they have no plan their updates are fairly useless and have not really affected gameplay. Polishing textures making stuff look better etc... The game has been virtually the same the past few months disappointingly. The more time goes on the more it feels like a scam. As an alpha game you expect the updates to be massive changes to the structure rather than focus on lower priorities. This is not to say they may not be working on important things but it has yet to be released.Everywhere there is discussion between the fan communities there is the same banter between constructive/deconstructive criticisms and zealous fans. ""Where's some real updates?!"" HAVE SOME PATIENCE YOU )#$*% IT TAKES TIME TO MAKE A GAME"" some feature is bugged and broken! fix it jerks!"" GIVE THEM A BREAK IT'S ALPHA CAN'T YOU READ ACEHOz GEEZ LA WEEZetc...Since it's alpha most of the loyal followers give them a free pass at everything as well as having infinite patience. The developers participation in dialogue with the community is fairly one way. There is a lack of transparency and warmth. In the end the developers' dearth of professionalism really shows. While it may not be a fair comparison the frequency and amount of updates in the patches in DayZ compared to Rust are quite surmountable. Rust could still be a great game but as of now I would be hesitant to give to these developers. This is 2014 lots of games are anticipated save your money for the big hitters.",waifu

cari Roblox,I love the story/singleplayer mode a lot more than the online multiplayer. The story mode gives purpose for gamers who like objective type of games. Also it creates different missions help the gamer experience almost everything the game has to offer such as the Stranger Things missions (like side missions you talk to certain strangers to get them). Additionally the story mode has 3 sets of characters with difference personalities which are Michael Franklin and Trevor (I love him the most cause he be wildin). On the other hand I'm not a real fan of grinding but online multiplayer is alright at first (because of the customizable character and beating random people) but it's highly recommended that you play with a friend because things can get lonely when you're soloing the missions or VIP/CEO works to earn money. Overall this game is all about the grinding to get more money to buy whatever when you're in online multiplayer mode and story mode lasts about 40 hrs? but it's imo worth it.,waifu

Right now you can connect the Rift but the over exaggerated head movements of the character cause nausea (at least for me).The only criticism I have that they did not change the mission design a lot compared to the older iterations of GTA the 3 Characters do not really make a difference for the game mechanics but enrich the story a lot. But overall I think that is okay because that is a typical GTA trademark and gives the violence a needed cartoony touch.,susah

There isn't one thing I disliked about this game.,"cecan, cogan"
tutor Bang Bang,I really love this game. I was watching it on Twitch for weeks before I ever bought it. I love survivor style games and competitive games so this fits a niche I've been trying to fill for quite some time. Right now there only seems to be 1 map with different weather effects but it is quite a huge map which makes it easily replayable. There is also supposed to be a new desert map coming which will be huge.,"gg, pro player"

joki Cyberpunk,I'm not a modder not for GTA. I've dabbled in it once in Single Player but that's becuase it ran dry of content. They moved to Multiplayer to add content. So there is content IN THE GAME that people who paid FULL PRICE for the SINGLE PLAYER game can't play. Now there's a cease and desist for the biggest modding engine in the game that almost every mod runs on. They're saying that modding the games we bought is illegal. I am NOT standing for that garbage. LOOK HOW MANY HOURS I HAVE. I clearly love GTA but I'm uninstalling after this.

Either im raging for getting killed in the first 60 seconds or screaming got you son tryna sneak up on me. This game being so early i only see better things to come.

joki Cyberpunk,#REGION LOCK CHINAbeen playing fps games since cs 1.6 till cs go and other worthy mentions like rainbow six siege l4d2 and battlefield was excited when pubg first came out since it offers a new competitive shooting game. took me nearly a few weeks to learn the controls the map layouts and even though i enjoy playing on solo memorable moments is playing with my friends till we even opened a discord channel so we can communicate in game better. however sadly to say this game is trash now. due to the fact that there are too many hackers currently i left 3rd person to play in ffp since there are less hackers but its all the same now. countless times we end up dying to hackers and its always the same nickname the same china pandatv nickname or some random numbers . this game is utter rubbish. we should just boycott it its either no recoil hacks esp hack or speed hack. the people at blueballs company ain't doing anything. just taking money and wiping china butt hole,"suhu, valorant, cecan"

cari Bang Bang,Rocket League is a fun and unique game where you play soccer but with a TWIST... you play with CARS! In Rocket League you can play ranked or unranked which is a ranking system from the highest rank to the lowest rank. You can get items to customize your car and even get different types of cars such as a boost wheels topper(hat) and many different skins and for the items you dont want you can trade with other players to get something better or if you have 5 of the same type of item ( Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Import Body Exotic And of course mystery decal) then you can trade it in for one item of a higher rarity. But beware of scammers! You can also train in the exhibiton or go there just for some fun! You can also buy crates which is a random item which could possibly be a mystery decal. And it's under 20$!!!! I definitely recommend this to anyone that like soccer or cars or BOTH and even if you dont like those 2 things it's still a really good game and i highly recommend you check it out NOW!!!,"cewek, valorant"

tutor GTA,The servers were fixed. The game runs pretty well on minimum specs and anyone still complaining just haven t turned off Volume Rendering Quality which is the fps killer.General info Monster Hunter World is the fifth game in the series not including the g rank versions or spin offs of the other games where you hunt well Monsters and take their skin and wear it with a continuing cycle until you rage quit or you re done.Gameplay The gameplay is good and enjoyable like in the previous titles. With multiple weapons the game offers multiple game styles for all kind of players like the long sword for weebs dual blades for no skill people hammer for people that want to play whack a mole greatsword for THATS A LOT OF DAMAGE and the best weapon THE SWORD AND SHIELD THAT CAN BASICALLY DO EVERYTHING WITH NO PROBLEMS etc. Then comes armor skills that have multiple gamestyle changing abilities like wide range makes you a support making you able to use your own items that would normally only heal and buff you to buff and heal your team mates but the skills come into play in High rank and are really important to either make the monster you re fighting easier or to make a set to rek with the greatsword.Story The story is really meh as in I liked Monster hunter 4 Ultimate s a lot more for having an enjoyable cast of character with personality other than Look at me I curious about everything and I do nothing else useful than give you quests and try to kill myself in every cutscene in the game forcing you to fight the monster I almost got killed by or kill you in the process.Some things for newbies This game is the easiest in the series by far with multiple quality of life changes and other improvements like gathering is a LOT faster than in previous games and other changes that make the game less grindy and easier which makes this the most newbie friendly from the seriesFew gripes I just have a few gripes with the game like how there isn t G Rank or how I get poisoned by Rathalos more than Pukei Pukei and how I hate the puffball.End thoughts The game is good but it has a few problems that can mostly be ignored so buy it on sale but if you want the game right now I d say buy it somewhere else for cheaper.,"pro player, waifu, mobile legend"

tutor Bang Bang,"Update 5/13/17Optimization has gotten a lot better. Haven't noticed any frame skipping anymore or rubberbanding. In general things have gotten a lot smoother.Still not a huge fan of the circle speed/timings...but I think I can live with it since everything else in the game has become a lot more playable. Also Devs have added cool things like custom matches. Started playing this game more in Duos than Solo and having a lot more fun that way. So I've changed my recommendation from a No to a Yes.Pre 5/13/17Can't recommend this game in its current state. Optimization is insanely bad frame skipping with a top of the line rig... combine that with rubberbanding servers and you sometimes have games where it's near impossible to hit anybody consistently. Audio cues in general are pretty bad as well. The circle timings seem really poorly thought out. So many games I've played running simulator for the entire game. You don't have time to engage in any fights in between phases or you risk dying very quickly in the ""gas"".I know optimization updates and other changes are in the pipeline... so I can revise my recommendation if those prove to improve quality of life across the board. The Battle Royale genre has such potential... but I think PUBG misses the mark just like H1Z1. Looking forward to what Islands of Nyne can bring to the table. This genre really needs a AAA developer polish. If only Valve or Blizzard would pick it up.","suhu, pro player"

The single player campaign is flawless and deserves an expansion since the characters were too funny and that'll be that. Beutiful graphics too 10/10 there no doubt about it and i'm not even running full spec settings!!! still looks amazing.But with all good things it must unfortunately come to an end.....If you are buying this game for it's online features I wouldn't recommend it to anyone despite all it's posh new stuff.There are multiple reasons for it too For starters the community is very much toxic and it's favourite word is ""noob"".....big suprise....people also like to trash you're vehicle repeatedly kill you for no apparent reason and then ofcourse there's the modders which is fair enough game has mods both SP and MP ones but the hackers/modders have found a way to spawn money ontop of you which sounds as pleasant as can be......then you'll get banned.....120% true stuff.But why so many hackers/modders? i'll tell you why too.It's because alike what happens with every ""Pay for just about everything"" franchise........it already has a cancer rotting and festering within' it...........They call this cancer.....SHARK CARDS!!!! A legal way for already rich millionaire dev's to fleece you for everything you got cause you like to drive cars that look cool and be one of life's ""big boys""......The hardline reality being that not everyone has this limited cache of real life money much alike everything is stupidly high priced to buy ordinarily on this game now. Even by grinding missions you're talking months to get and upgrade 1 vehicle because they made those a wreck too reducing actual rewards and then ramping up prices in game items.......So based on the fact that a lot of people don't have that endless time or money available what other choice do they have apart from to hack? ofcourse...........you guessed it!!!! &lt it's SHARK CARDS... 70 $150 of real life money (more than some average in a week pay).........for 8 million gta cash.........ummmmmm no.........that doesn't sound right.......cause paying that much and recieving that much might upgrade you a single car or 2 at the absolute maximum not taking into consideration all the other fabulous new features that are always just out of reach unless you can whip up plenty and lots of ker ching!!!!!So nope............pants nada..........not recommended.R* have messed this game up completely by over pricing everything it's just not worth it...","cogan, mobile legend, cecan"

tutor VALORANT,With having been a HUGE fan of h1z1. I can honestly 100% say that this game blows it out of the water.I was nervous that I would get bored with this game quick after investing so much time in a game of the same exact style. But once I felt the shooting mechanics I immedietly realized what H1 was always missing... A GREAT DEVELOPER. Maybe one the best I have ever experienced with a game. Everything they say they will do... They do... Its not just releasing half of what they say for one big update every half a year and then have the game offline for 2 days. Daybreak ruined a great thing and they only have themselves to blame... They were money hungry with the paid content. When all they had to do was just deliver on fixing there game. This game has made the developers millions of dollars and will make millions more. H1Z1 is now dead in the water. With a scramble to start being a good developer its to little to late. Battle grounds is here.... And its here to stay. Jump in. Jump out of a plane. And get to looting folks! STOP READING AND JUST BUY IT!(as far as this being an early access title) It wont be for long. Maybe half year tops. Because that is what the developer said. And that is what the developer will do. Yes there is a hacker problem (apprently) I don't know if I have expereinced any in my 200 hours of game play. But GUESS WHAT. The developer will do everything they possibly can and they will fix it. They promised optomization first. And every update is a HUGE improvement. So when they decide to tackle the hackers.. IT WILL BE UPDATE AFTER UPDATE fixing the problem as well.

tutor PUBG,If you played The Culling before the cancer patch you will probably like this game. It's basically the same besides a lot more people and the combat is largely focussed around guns. So it will be pretty hard for the developers to make the combat system slower **cough**culling**. A large amount of the complaints for this game are focused around micro transactions. Something to note is that all of the items you can buy on the steam market are cosmetics that in no way alter your gameplay. On top of that if you are like me couldn't care less about running around in a yellow suit. You can just sell everything on the steam market. I've made like 7 dollars by selling garbage to kids with their moms credit card but if you get really lucky some items are worth hundreds. So there is that on top of the game being super fun(mainly with friends). Only con I can think of is it seems to mainly drive off your cpu. So if you have a great gpu and a ehh cpu like me you are probably going to be playing on low medium.,free fire

Weekly updates and new items added all the time. Love the building aspect of the game. Good work. That was my review about a year ago. I've stopped playing Rust after they started adding all these AI and tanks mini games work benches and componets. Game has lost itself. My favorite time in Rust was during the BP system and the only AI was the attack heli. You don't feel alone anymore there is AI scientist everywhere when trying to loot the attack heli the CH47 event a tank patroling a Rad town. I just don't find it fun anymore.

The game has a ""Sleeper"" system which basically means that whenever you log off your body falls to the ground asleep and you then get robbed and killed when you are away so if you want to progress you can't log off. Early shelters are easily broken into so all your progress can and will be reset if you aren't willing to sink 4 hours of just farming materials when you start up to get a decent house. Unfortunately even higher quality homes are easily broken into due to the easy availability of C4. Expect to lose everything and have to restart often it's fun for a bit then it just gets old. Game encourages bullying of newer players expect to be shot by more experience players for fun regularly. Players are actively malicious and often attempt to trap you in cells so that you can only get out by starving and wasting 20 minutes of your time. Horrible playerbase poorly thought out mechanics.

Now I might be able to deal with the pain that is other people if they were just an added challenge but they aren't. People are voices. PEople are persistant. People are evil.And this game has produced some weird kind of evil at that. Day Z is downright friendly in comparison and CoD voice chat a cheerful conversation in the quad. That said that could (probably is) the very reason many people like this game so perhaps I might've recommended it instead but that would leave an even worse taste in my mouth than playing it.,"valorant, free fire, sepuh"

tutor FF,good joke game to play with friendsi cant recommend it for 28 whatsoever (compared to the free alternatives)if you're into the combat in arma and a slower more tactical based battle royale then by all means get this game.Personally though im not a great fan of the slower pace of this game. Everyone ive encountered has shot me from somewhere i cannot see them (leaning behind a tree or hiding in grass using a suppressed weapon) and nearly all my kills are from me hiding in tall grass or in a bush waiting for an unsuspecting player to walk by.im also not a massive fan of the cosmetics system in this game either. I feel at the start everyone looks very similar and once you save up your hard earned bp you end up getting a crate you need a key to open. the basic loot inside these crates i dont exactly like and the neato looking cosmetics are all rare and so have a high value. After they removed the clothing spawns ingame ive never been able to find any neat cosmetics when searching a house (i love the trenchcoat haha) and i dont see why they've done this. Sure it increases normal loot spawns but they can make them seperate and so you find weapons with the clothing.in my last few matches i havent really encountered any noticable bugs. which is a great improvement from when i used to play. The game used to be horrible to play bad fps loads of bugs and the graphics looked like doo doo. However i don't know if anyone else finds that its different for them.Anyhow its a fun lil game. best played with friends. however id wait untill this game goes on sale (if i ever does cos i dont think ive ever seen it on sale),"valorant, gg"

Skill is used to wield various weapons and know your limits when matching up against people. Can you kill those 4 nakeds chasing after you with only a spear and a hatchet on you? That's your call. Trust lies in the people you surround yourself with. Rust is an almost completely unpredictable game because you have no idea how people are going to react to the way you play. Killing that silly naked who wanted some food for free may have seemed like a hilarious idea at the time but maybe not so much when he shows up with 20 friends in full gear to your front door. And allowing that guy access to your whole base after you've only known him for 2 hours? I can tell you from experience it's not fun to log on and find that your base is no longer yours. They let me know that loud and clear as they screamed at me over their mics )Be friendly or be mean it's your call either way you have the ability to succeed immensely or end up homeless.PROTIPS Throwing spears are op AK is best gun pipeshotty is best gun for the poor don't build next to a spawn find some friends don't be too friendly don't eff with a clan unless you can back it up wall off your toolcupboard have an ""airlock"" in your front entrance pillars are 100% worth sharing sleeping bags saves 2 hours trying to find your friend if you wear clothes you will get shot 90% of the time if you're naked you will get shot 50% of the time everyone can hear you c4 people saying ""friendly"" almost never are nakeds aren't always what they appear to be hv ammo isn't worth the gp building on rocks makes for easy defense ladders really don't cost that much don't keep all your loot in one place keep up to date on glitches craft on the run have a ton of sleeping bags you can never have too many doors you can smelt/cook 4 items at a time don't plan your house too big salvaged tools are bad burst fire your gun deers come installed with vtec don't trust beancan grenades explosives can blow up the chests inside geared doesn't mean good or smart follow these tips and I'll still kill you )TL DR Best $20 I've ever spent.","susah, pro player"

cari Minecraft,Game is amazing. Lots of fun. As far as the people complaining about lag spikes and fps drops. The game is still in EARLY ACCESS and the game is nowhere near complete. Yes they maybe adding crates and paid keys right now but these do not affect the gameplay. They are only cosmetic items and if they want to add them let them. Does not mean you need to buy into the keys. Microtransactions is just a way for a game to keep the servers up and the developing to continue on. I experience very few problems with lag or fps drops but I also have played many early access games and expect there to be problems until the game is fully released.,gg

A year in and they STILL haven't fixed glitches that have been in the game since day one.Instead they keep adding paid DLC killers.It could be amazing I like it decently enough but it's frustrating to see the dev team make random dev decisions instead of planning well and implementing actual solutions.

cari Minecraft,UPDATE The game is still very buggy the lag is still present but at times worse as the server cant even keep 10 people on one server from having severe lag constantly then you have these idiots that go around and put pillars everywhere so that no one can find a spot to build the devs need to address this issue quickly the dinos arent running through my house anymore yet you start as a lvl 1 and will have lvl 116 birds come from the sky and attack up non stop at the early stages this being said the devs still have yet to address real issues they feel its more important to keep pushing out new content while they are turning a blind eye to the acts people are using to grief others to the point they cant even play the game also when they do updates that dont require client restarts if your on your flying mount you are automatically dismounted in air to fall to your death then you cant find your mounts anymore also in my case my first week back to try the game yet again i had to relocate my base 3 times because the devs kept changing the boundary lines for the updates they put out so in a short if you like the devs ing you up or like being griefed by other players in PVE not just PVP then this game is the bucket of youve been waiting for.Still would not recommend this to anyone at the current point In the games current state I would suggest that you hold off on your purchase of said product. The game is fun when playable. However there are alot of server issues with the game in its current state where the lag spikes can get you killed in more ways then one for example i was swimming the server hit a huge lag spike my character then was dead by the time the lag subsided from drowning another time i was out harvesting items to build my house when yet another lag spike reared up and i was attacking my a group of raptors and by time the spike went away yet again i was dead.Other game breaking issues that still havent been fix are the fact the dinos can kill you through walls inside your house when your not there then when you log in your house is not destroyed but youve been killed in my case this has happened 3 different times on one very fustrating occasion i logged in to being killed and having all of my items missing from my house even though my house was still intact so i was apparently killed through walls and the dinos destroyed all the items in my house not anyone else as this was a PVE server and not a PVP server. And today i logged into having been killed again by dinos but to top it off my home was filled with rocks to the point I couldnt enter or exit or get to my chests to create a item with which to break them with. Im tired of seeing these developers adding in new content while failing to prioritize the game killing bugs like the ones mentioned above. these devs are not addressing any of the major issues instead they keep pouring in more and more content ( which is good for a finished product) but in this case they are not holding themselves up to a level of detail that I myself would claim to be professional the content adding should be halted until they have the major issues fixed.If you dont care about losing hours of work or dying in your home from dinos that seem to be like casper the ghost and your not easily fustrated at things like that then this game maybe fun for you if your like me who has PTSD and gets upset because your dying from random things like server lag and dinos that go through walls then i suggest you save you money and spend it else where on a finished product that has good reviews.this game has good reviews but to many are fan boys who adobt games early and can find no flaws or just dont care that there money is spent on good quality products so as of now i cannot recommend this game knowning that is has major issues that alot of people are not addressing.,wibu

I have had multiple times where someone would be scoped in on the ground and then snap to my head then killing me ruining my duos and solos. Not to mention I have qued into duos and squad and have gotten 2 people that spoke english in my whole time playing PUBG. Sometimes you will have lag and hit reg problems but those problems seem to be dwarfed by the hackers/cheaters. I want to love this game and I do love it but I can't recommend this game until they fix the major problem which imo is the cheaters. Only then can they start to fix the hit reg and lag issues that are present.,waifu

Fun Squad based gameplay with 1 or 3 of your friends. ( or MM with strangers ) Good Sized map / easy to navigate. Simple but effective loot system. Unlimited replay value. Rewarding victories 1st &amp 3rd person modesCons Poorly optimized / FPS drops stutters Extremely CPU intensive w/ poor results Hit ditection is terrible at times ( most of the time it's sub par ) Desync ( Iv rarely experienced this but many others have ) Gameplay feels clunky at times especially where jumping is involved. Audio / Directional sound is awful / when it's raining on the map you can hear nothing else. Terrible community ( but this is just gaming in general in 2017 ) Developers banning people for exploiting bugs in early access Developers banning people for "" stream snipping "" Microtransactions in early access after the developer "" promised "" there wouldn't be any until the game was complete Decent amount of cheaters 1 hit kill HS punches ( like why lmao ? ) Melee weapons besides the pan are essentially useless Lack of weapons 5 are only obtainable through random crate drops on the map.

So here's what happend to me I sat down going all out upgrading my equipment. Was so happy with all my new crafter stuff I went on an online quest (which for some reason didn't saved anything before I started it).... I landed... started collecting lots of cool stuff (again I was happy)...... and then all of a sudden a disconnection!Came back and guess what? NOTHING was saved.

cari DOTA,This game is crap There are people in it that can shoot you when you are crouched behind a corner with bullets that can appearently turn 90 degrees mid flight and hit you when you are crouched behind a wall far around the corner. This of course verified with the Kill Cam. Not sure if its a better attempt at what Dayz started or if I prefer Dayz although both seem to be in the same catagory of unfinished possibly neverendingly unfinished and buggy. What annoys especially with a game I dont care much to play anymore after all this is the constant massive updates and then the recent addition of the 26.2 mb update every 4 hours it seems not sure if this 26.2mb update is just needed every 4 hours to fix something the developers messed up with one of the daily 9 GB patches you have for the game. They update so much with the game so often they lose track of where they messed up what it seems. So now they need this 26.2mb update every 4 hours or more to keep the servers going or something kicking the can on a problem they can't seem to resolve at its source. Don't buy into all the hype.,"suhu, waifu"
joki NINTENDO,This game is great. A great premise and a great format. There are a few issues but some of them are just inherent to the game itself.1. You're first couple rounds of survivor are actually pretty scary. After about match 10 it just becomes a game a great game but no longer heart pounding scary. So if you have a family member you want to scare the crap out of the investment is well worth it.2. Balance will always be tricky to get just right. The Devs have consistently listened to the community and added great things to the game and adjusted the worst parts. People will complain about Decisive strike and dead hard all day but I still remember when you didn't have any hooks on the map! Good luck killing anyone like that!3. Hook camping is a fun sapper. Since the games inception camping hooks is the biggest complaint I ever had. There really isn't anything the survivors can do about it except keep doing objectives but that makes the gameplay completely boring for the person who got hooked and the killer is actually missing out on tons of BP but they never listen.So I highly recommend this game for everyone except those who are squimish about blood and gore.,"jodoh, susah, cewek"
joki FF,"The singleplayer content is excellent. There's a reason after 2 years I find myself going back and spending hours there with no regret. The multiplayer doe? Just avoid itIf you want some of the multiplayer functions look for ""MP cars in SP"" mods. Trust me it's a shame they hidden a lot of cool weaponised vehicles (yes there are a lot of weaponised vehicles including another tank) and you can even summon bodyguards drivers and more. Basically you get 70% of the GTA online fun without hackers or rockstar mods or really any intervention.",pro player

tutor Destiny,I've only had a couple sessions with this game so far but I've been a bystander for a while and would still like to voice my opinion on this game which I don't do a lot. Not on Steam anyways.I can't recommend this game to anyone even if you plan to play with friends. It's only fun for maybe an hour or two. It's buggy and unpolished from the developers overall laziness and greed. Maybe if they were to pull their head out of their own bum and see the major issues with this game and why another game similar is doing so much better and overall is a better game. I got it as a gift from a friend and I'm glad I did so because it wasn't going to get a cent of my money.,"jodoh, pro player, cewek"

(Sometimes not)In Killer side you can relieve the stress also you can show your inner cruel.Of course it's little bit hard game to people who can play less than 10games but after you got a skill and the rules and many situation you will proud of you that you bought this game.(In my view point blance isn't that bad cuz is up to Killer or map)Most important thing is this game isn't need that much of your computer spec that much.Also this game is less than 5GB. lol (Not sure about GB. Might be less than that)정말 재미있는 게임입니다. 생존자에서 하시던 살인마 역활을 하시던간에 즐거움을 느낄수 있습니다.생존자측에서 플레이 하실경우에 팀플레이와 공포를 느끼시며 게임을 즐기실수 있으며때때로 팀원을 버리는 과감한 선택이 필요하기도 합니다.살인마를 플레이 하실경우 물론 공포감은 없지만 생존자들을 줄여나갈때의 쾌감과 승리를 만끽할수 있는 좋은 게임입니다. 비슷한 게임으로 이볼브가 있지만 이볼브처럼 큰 용량을 필요료 하지도 않으며 속칭 '조선컴'에서도 돌어갈만한 괜찮은 게임입니다.,sepuh

joki DOTA,"Singleplayer is amazing. The story characters map. Even after playing over and over again it's still entertaining. I like it way more than the GTA 4's story.As for online this is the reason why I don't recommend the game because I think that most people nowadays buy the game mainly because of the online. Don't get me wrong I used to love it played over 400 hours of pure online everything was awesome I thought that this is the perfect multiplayer game they are constantly updating it and there is a lot of stuff which has become the problem. A year and a half ago everything was more or less balanced the prices were reasonable. After the Import/Export things were getting drastically different. Looked like this to me ""Hey buddy want to enjoy the content? Well you should get our brand new garage only for 2M.""Then Gunrunning. Again my overall feelings ""Look at this cool update! The players will be able to get their bunkers only for 1.5M. Also don't forget to upgrade your equipment for another 1M. Did we forget to mention that getting additional people working for you will only cost you half a million? By the way you will time from time get raided and lose everything unless you buy another cameras for 400K! All the raids will magically disappear! Want to modify your weapons in your Workshop? Well too bad you need a trailer for that but don't worry it's only 1 to 2 and a half millions. Do you want to train your shooting? There you go only for 700K! Do you prefer white over black? The paint costs 105K so... Did we mention that you can take a nap there? The key for that room costs 265K. Do you want a Gun Locker which you will probably never use? That will be 175K. You want some caddies? 85K or 120K if you want to have them larger. Don't forget to check out the new cars! Get yourself a car that shoots a couple of missiles only for 4 5M!""How I felt about Smuggler's Run Hello there! This update will be about planes. Want a hangar? 1 to 5M. Which style would you prefer? The one for 100k or the one for 320k? Want different lights? No problem the more expensive style you chose the more expensive lights you'll get! Isn't that cool? Want some nice 'art' on the floor? Sure we'll paint it for you costs only up to 200k just like your apartment you bought last year to do heists! Furniture? You mean another wall? That's another 280k for you. Again want the keys to access your bed? 235k 375k. You want to customize your 500k glider? One word WORKSHOP! And guess what this number 1 150 000 means... Correct! It's the price!""The prices of the content added were skyrocketing if you wanted to truly enjoy the game you had to either make money all day long if you wanted to be a fair dude that doesn't hack which is by the way another big problem with this game or buy some cards that are horribly overpriced. At this point I didn't have time to play all day long I didn't want to hack and I totally didn't want to spend twice the price of the game on some cards so I stopped playing. Since then I've been ignoring the game not watching any videos and not paying attention to the updates. Sometimes when I notice that there's an update I come back for a couple of minutes and look how a vehicle with a couple of missiles costs over 4 millions. Now another heist update you might think this ""Oh finally another heist things are getting back to the state when you could buy a house for 200k and get full content.""The reality however looks like this ""Hey it's nice to see you back in the game look at this brand new heist room only for 2 millions the same idea only way more expensive.""And as a person who doesn't have that much time to play anymore I can't enjoy the content anymore. Another problem with this game are the hackers. I finally am thrown into a lobby after 10 minutes of loading I see that I am immediately teleported to an airport from my house with a couple of other people and I am stuck doing some rather strange animations. I always report the guy when I find out who it is but it doesn't seem to help. I've heard some heartbreaking stories of people getting banned for no reason this luckily hasn't happened to me yet.","waifu, free fire"

We'll see if they fix the problemsThis game has an AMAZING concept and really needs to be better. I love the gameplay. When it works. WAY too many bugs. I will change my review and sing the games praises if the creators put more energy into fixing bugs. This game was NOT worth the price I paid for it considering how often it simply doesn't work. Buttons sometimes don't register. I've healed people who have already exited and survived. I've fallen through the floor of the map and died. COUNTLESS times I have been sitting waiting at the loading screen until I realize I need to force close the program. You have to make a new party when you want to change who the killer is. Only killer can be host. Garbage. Your core gameplay is really good and the game deserves to not be soffocated by having broken bells and whistles. Fix the game and I'll fix the review.,"waifu, jodoh"
cari Minecraft,Take two interactive now seem to have a stricks anti modding policy with effectively banning OpenIV (the backbone to a large amount of GTA V mods) they aim to push people away from single player and into multiplayer in an effort to make them spend more money on micro transactions.

cari GTA,Nope. They refuse to fix their game. All they see are the dollars signs rolling in and ignore the MAJOR issues with a large portion of their playerbase. Their inability to limit the rampant hacking and cheating has gone too far. They know it's a major issue and yet it has been months and months with nothing. Every third game is ruined by a hacker BUT they care more about putting a unoptimized XBOX port out then fixing the issues staring the millions of customers in the face who purchased the game and are being ignored. Stop worrying about cosmetics and loot boxes because when you try and release something new down the road all of us customers will remember how you did NOTHING and will not purchase from these developers again. Think long and hard if you want to have a frustrating gaming experaince because PUBG Corp/Bluehole refuse to do anything that doesn't line their pockets. 100% the wrong way to do business.,"pro player, waifu, suhu"

Having conquered these at an elementary level the fun starts for real. There's really no limit to the amount of idiotic tenuously difficult flying actions you can perform.

cari COD,"First I owned the PS3 version then bought the PC version lured in by some gameplays on youtube.I already finished story mode in the PS3 version (finished as in I got bored by the bland characters without any agency other than ""gotta make that paper brah"" and stopped playing the game because the world was boring and the cops were killing any and all fun to be had) so I basically bought this for online mode.The good things first OptimizationThe game runs great. The Framerate seldom dips. GraphicsIt looks pretty good.Now about the negative aspects. GTA online is a boring grind. I told myself I'd not care about money and levels but it turns out you have to and you have to grind the same few jobs over and over and over to get money and rank points to level up because EVERYTHING is hidden behind a pay and rank wall so tall Trump would tell Rockstar to take it down a notch. The payouts are really poor so it takes you forever to save up money for something you'd like but can't buy because your level isn't high enough. Now I wouldn't mind this if the races were fun but all I get is the same boring supercar race (looking at you congestion charge) over and over then maybe some ""muscle up"" perhaps one or another offroad race but they're all equally dull.Where the hell are the oddball races? Taking rusty tractors down Mt. Chiliad? Racing golf carts on a runway which planes are taking off and landing on? Cycling on the freeway in the opposing lane with traffic on? Helicopter races through the wind mill farm? Faggios through a cow farm? ANYTHING ELSE THAN ANOTHER ""DRIVE THIS EXOTIC SUPERTURD ON THE SAME COURSE YOU'VE DRIVEN ON COUNTLESS TIMES JUST TO GET THAT MEASLY PAYOUT?""Oh"" you'll say ""Just make these races yourself and then host them"".Yeah I'll make them and then grow a nice beard waiting for even one soul to join. Sounds like real fun.In the end this game feels like nothing but a skinner box to make people buy shark cards.",jodoh
cari Minecraft,"For those who have played ARK the style of gameplay is very similar.Collect items from the world around you build tools to colelct from new sources/more efficiently and don't let the vicious animals see you or they will eat your face. In Rust however there is no character creation. You all spawn as a big naked dude. Thank goodness for the pixelation or else I would have had a LOT of explaining to do to my mother.It is quite difficult to figure out what you are doing in this game especially on a server. I reccomend either finding an empty server or starting one in order to get used to what is going on. Early game it's easiest to hang around the towns where you can readily find blueprints water food and items.Right click is usually ""throw"" avoid clicking this unless you want to fling your items into the bushes to be lost forever.As far as finding your friends navigating the map is rather hard. My suggestion would be to either find a rad town and follow the road/powerlines until you locate one another or to have one person set up a quick base with a sleeping bag for the other person to spawn in.Starting as a new player on a server with established clans isn't going to work. You are going to be killed repeatedly it's going to be frustrating and you're never going to get to actually play the game. PVE servers are great for learning and the people there are usually very willing to help you along just pay attention to the rules.Helicopters are evil. If you hear a helicopter RUN. You cannot win againt this thing without some serious firepower. Hide somewhere with a decent roof and away from open windows/doors.Watch the sound levels especially when first logging on. If you think the footsteps are loud? Wait till someone sets off a shotgun near your head. I about jumped out of my skin.There are a few serious glitches in the game but nothing that absolutely breaks it. Be warned bear traps do NOT in fact work on bears. Doors can be glitched through under the right circumstances and occasionally the naked people who logged off will float above the ground for no apparent reason.Overall this is a fun game but seems to be one where you can upgrade everything to a point and then have nothing left to do. This is solved on PVP servers by having others around to attack/be attacked by however it leaves little to do for those on less populated or PVE servers. Hopefully there will be more updates for the game as I am greatly enjoying it so far and hope to continue.","susah, wibu, cogan"

tutor Cyberpunk,Product received for free. The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Special Edition is a worse version compared to Vanilla one. Pros + Has better textures + They 've corrected previous game mechanic issues like saving a game. What i mean is that in the vanilla version for expample when you ended the game you had lets say 5.000 saves and when you begun a new one you had like 5.001. in Special Edition when you end the game and you have 5.000 saves now when you begin a new game you have actually 0 saves. + They've added the Mod option in the game menu which is very comfortable compared to Vanilla one. + SE now supports 64 bit which means it is in theory capable of loading so much more into memory and in turn that should mean far more epic modsCons The sound quality has been seriously downgraded Vanilla Skyrim has tons of mods compared to SE meaning more choicesNevertheless i do recommend the game. If I gave in Vanilla 20/10 then i should give in Special Edition 8/10.,mobile legend

cari NINTENDO,I got around 70h playtime in story mode as i do not like the comments about online version and didn't play it.Story mode so single player was fun so far but slowly (actually since a while) it is getting boring.Actually all i was doing was driving cars shoot around grab guns from police and military and running away from them...Tried to explore building but all was closed (99%of it).I played a little bit of mission goals but that was boring after 6 7 mission. Then changing the characters?Don't know what is that good for I hate that already from resident evil.It is a huge world but somehow dead (except you can drive cars shoot at people fight with the police)But hey i saw it now and i played Dying Light &amp Just Cause 3 before and the world there is so much alive and much more interesting more fun to play. Going back there Sayonara!Would like to recommend the game but can't do that 'cos most of the time i fight police to take their guns/ammot???And online part isn't really playable according to already existing comments.Can't recommend your game becasue of that...,free fire

joki Cyberpunk,Product received for free. Hmm what to say here. Take a 5 year old game and give it a new coat of paint and a new engine. That pretty much sums up this version of the game. If your used to playing the game modded your likely to end up disappointed. However now that Skyrim is on a 64 bit platform the new mods for the game will have far less constraints. If you have an unmodded save however you can directly copy the save into this version and it will work. Honestly asking if you like this version is the same as asking what your favorite color is. Skyrim is still skyrim and personally I like that I can now dump more then 4GB of memory into the application. Besides that I havent really noticed much difference.,cewek

cari GTA,Monster Hunter World is both an entry point in the series for an audience who have only ever heard of the monter slaying slasher and a remake of the formula for an age old series that has fans of both the west and east joining together to explore the new world.As a long time fan of the series I was both excited and cautious of this instillation in the series due to its major change in both platform and gameplay. The open world aspect of each map seemed like both a dream and curse as I explored new rich environments and quickly learnt that the vastness could be my downfall in a fight. Although the new maps and world as a whole are a challenging change in mechanics and strategy the beauty of a small enclosed beach or a view over a vast lush forest can leave you lost for words during a difficult hunt.The veriety in weapons hasn't changed since the last title however the way that weapons are presented has changed considerably. Each weapon being in your box from the start like in every start to a MH Game but the practice area allows for in depth training that can make a world of difference when learning a new weapons style. As this is a new world that also means new monsters which will also lead to a new array of weapon and armor match ups all of which in the later game can be mixed to boost specififc stats and allow you to hunt to your full potential.The multiplayer is also heavily sold for hunts in both the story and in the Gathering hub for more advanced hunters allowing you to team up with friends or just friendly hunters to get through a hunt with ease. This doesn't however limit the solo experience as the difficulty level will increase with every added hunter leaving no solo hunter at a disadvantage to a monster should they choose to go it alone.In conclusion Monster Hunter World is a sensational step forward for the franchise showing advanced graphics on both console and PC and a system that can be sustained through teams or solo artists to achieve the very best results in a hunt. The game is gripping from A Z and although there can be some slow slopes to the story during investigation sections these all link to a greater mission that will prove to be a challenge to any capable hunter.10/10 would put far too much of my free time into this game again.,"valorant, cecan"
cari Bang Bang,I've only played MH4U on 3DS and while it was fun I did struggle quite a bit. But MHW is a lot easier allowing for new people to learn the game and have fun. I do thoroughly enjoy this game and I personally have no qualms with it. I do strongly recommend it if you've been looking to get in to MH this is the best way to wet your feet. I don't have the best hardware i5 4590 and a 2nd hand Fury X I can with a mix of med and high setting run 1440p at 60FPS and the load times are SO much faster than they are on console it's a joke. I have not had the issues plaguing others my internet disconnects are due to my powerline adapter but even then I rarely DC and it's never happened during multiplayer only solo. I hate paying $80 CAD for games as there is always other BS DLC to add on but with MHW I don't mind the price. In today's age where you need a season pass or other crap to get a full game MHW is a full fledged game with Capcom constantly pushing updates and events without asking for an extra penny. I strongly recommend MHW.,"suhu, free fire"

joki COD,"Heya All I am very happy for this update. I have played with Vanilla Skyrim SE and like what I see so far. However I am tabling it for now until some mods I like get converted. I beat skyrim on an un modded playthru during origional release. So I got that feel already. These days I prefer the modded experiance for some aspects of my play thru.SE Pros Updated Base World Graphics Asthetics and ENB (lighting). Seems to be nicer and more true to Bethesda fantasy but with better graphics. So possibly may not need as many visual mods. Played for a short while looked at many world textures and I personally am happy. Engine Converted to 64 Bit allowing game and some mods to function better on current PCs. This paves the way for potentially new mods that can do much more than before. Thats up to the creativeness of the community though.SE Cons ""Unofficial Skyrim Patch"" was not integrated into the base game to my knowledge. I do not know if Bethesda performed any offical bug fixes to the base game or not. But my hunch is we will still need the ""Unofficial Skyrim Patch"" to fix alot of things in the world. Some players have tried the patch on Skyrim SE but it seems to cause problems. So we need to wait for the mod to be updated to work better with Skyrim SE. Old textures on Armors weapons equipment house hold objects dungeon objects and thousands of other items don't look updated to me. Looking forward to the Static Mesh improvement mod HD weapon/Armor mods to be converted to Skyrim SE. Not looking for non skyrim items/equipment meshes. Just would like higher quality meshes for existing skyrim equipment. Kinda the bridge between lore friendly and better looking. Not older PC friendly. If you ran Skyrim on High/Ultra 5 6 years ago you might be at low/Medium settings today with Skyrim SE. If you've updated your computer since then like I did. You might still be at High/Ultra. No NPC or Character mesh/skin updates. Still have origional character looks/feels. Will need modding to touch up some people. Waiting for CBBE to be converted... Don't judge me... &gt .&gt Many older Mods may never work again unless the Mod Author comes back to update it or another mod author takes over the project and tries to update it.Other Notes PC Performance. Some users are reporting sinificant performance issues with their computers. When they list their system specs and I compare it to mine sometimes we're fairly similar. Yet I am not noticing any visual or perfomance issues. My rig is a Win 10 PRO i7 6700k 32GB ram GeForce GTX 970 and Samsung Evo 850 SSDs. Some users are reporting Bugs with the starting scene on the cart. No mods yet the cart still flips the fraq out or the Horses get in the way during the execution scene. Hopefully a bugfix will come for that soon. Mod Development will take time folks. Its up to you to decide if you want to play a limited mod experiance or wait for a while. thank you all and I hope you enjoy the updates and updated mods. Good luck Mod Makers. Im rooting for you.",pro player

joki Genshin Impact,I cant reccomend this game after 140 hours the story mode is good but can get boring. In online mode there is way to many hackers and i dont think the devs do anything about it the only thing the've done is take away 7 million of my hard earned dollars for no reason which is stupid.,valorant
tutor Clash Royale,Worst game you will ever play when the servers aren't crashing and you are losing all your progress for that game the game will bug and leave you without a HUD worst game to play competitively if at all. i would rate it 1/10 it is just all round terrible and all they want is your money,"mobile legend, cecan"
joki VALORANT,The single player is all kinds of fun but the multiplayer has been turned into a grindfest due to the greed of Take Two &amp Rockstar. If you have a patience of a saint and no real life job you might be able to grit your teeth and power on through to open up all the content but for most people with real world commitments you're going to have to buy shark cards if you want to experience all GTA Online has to offer. Everything has a cost. Want a fully upgraded car? That's an extra couple of hundred thousand. Want to grind missions? You'll burn through ammo and armour. Want access to the latest content? That's a cool 1.5 million ish to gain access to facitlities needed to launch it all.There's a reason Rockstar are now offering up a starter pack for 39.99...,jodoh

tutor PUBG,Not the best of reputations as a developer but this game keeps you coming back with a fork and knife for that chicken dinner. So as long as they update it and add more guns maps and vehicles this game will be a new CS GO. One of the best parts of this game is the randomness of it. The fact that you can ride a bike over a mountain through an upstairs window and kill a squad is absolutely insane. Definitely the best battle royale on the market currently.,cecan

cari Cyberpunk,It's a great game. There are a lot of options and game modes to play online. The only problem is the toxic people but that's life. You can blame Rockstar Take Two o whoever you want but people is like that. There's no online game without toxic people and this game is a good place for them. Some people will try to ruin your game just for fun.Biggest problem modders. You will find a hacker in every two games. I find it unbelievable how usual it is to find a hacker. I really can't understand how Rockstar doesn't have anything prepared to detect them as soon as they're triggered because they're everywhere literally. It's a huge problem you'll have to find a new server very often. Also you'll see a lot of kids asking for modders in the chat.If you can get around hackers and toxic people you will find a great game. You can do missions play minigames races and make a lot different things. It's hard to get all the stuff you want though as things are expensive and you'll need to spend a lot of time to get all the money you need to buy them.Apart from the online you have the singleplayer wich is very good too although you'll end up playing online or not playing at all.,"cewek, gg, cogan"

cari Clash Royale,Good single player story with lots of stuff to do until you 100% it and then decide to play online as online is the only mode that is still supported with this game. Then we come to why this review is a downvote which is the online experience is awful in its current state every lobby is filled with ethier trolls or hackers that can't be killed or have unlimited money and cheats and will kill you instantly with said cheats along with the ability to kick you from lobbies. Combined with the crappy customer support that bans players that dont even cheat and will not negotiate the ban even if it were to be a mistake. The online is also ruined by it being designed around shark card microtransactions as everything is so expensive and you earn money so slow you almost have to spend real world money in order to unlock any new features that are added in a reasonable amount of time. Final Verdict If you want a good singleplayer game get this on sale when its less than $15 $20 and if you are wanting a good multiplayer experinece just skip this game and spend your money elsewhere.,"gg, cewek, mobile legend"

tutor COD,Literally had to change my rating for this game. I was very supportive for PUBG. I gave it a chance and I also gave Fortnite a chance. But after seeing and reading about PUBG sueing Fortnite again for 'copyrighting'. I just have to give this game a super negative review. It's absolutely ridiculously that they re doing what they re doing. Fortnite got their games under control. I don t have a single hiccup. But after days and days for weeks to months. I still have optimization problems cheating problems and just problems after problems with this game. Don t forget about the stupid loot boxes where you have the buy every keys for every boxes. The customizing is unappealing. It s so dull and just plain out boring. PUBG is like the now of DC and Fortnite s the Marvel. Stop suing other companies when you re NOT original. Focus more of your damn game. Fix the bugs and bugs and bugs! FIX IT! Stop being an immature baby stand the heck up and fix the darn thing. Geez,"cogan, sepuh"

Different game modes like hoops dropshot and rumble add a new fun spin and im sure there are more modes in the works as the game updates regularly. Competitive is optimized well and they are always tweaking it. Competitive can be frustrating but that is the same with any game. Overall i would say this game is a solid 9.5/10. I would change it to 10/10 with more game modes but that is being very nitpicky.,pro player

tutor Destiny,I have been playing this game for over 20 hours and have experienced a certain number of issues and bugs. My main issue is that every time I drop into the game the map doesn't fully load and a lot of textures and buildings are missing. It takes about two minutes for the game map to load in and by that time other players have the opportunity to collect loot while I sit there and wait. It isn't just my game either other players have posted on forums that they have the same issue. I asked my friend who has played the game longer than I have and has told me many players have the same issue. He gave me a few methods to try and solve this issue but none of them has worked. I hope that this issue gets fixed but until then I am going to stop playing this game until I see more improvements.,"cecan, sepuh"

I could live with the FPS drop if I could at least play with someone who speaks my language. It seems likely that they might have also been banned a time or two with names like ""56894565"".

tutor Resident Evil,I started playing GTA back when I was a lot younger. Vice City is what got me into the series however none of the other games caught my attention quite like 5 did. I played GTA IV a lot but never completed the campaign because I always got bored halfway through. GTA V on the other hand... I COULD NOT PUT DOWN. I love every aspect of it. (Other than the story not including more heists.) The 3 protagonists are thought out very well. They each have so much character and soul and rockstar packed in a great story to go with it. Just from the prologue I got instantly HOOKED! I would recommend this game to everyone and anyone no matter what games they're into. It's worth finishing at least once. (This is my 3rd time owning the game!) Rockstar did a great job with map design and their attention to detail is INCREDIBLE. So many little obscure details you wouldn't find in any other game that makes GTA V so unique. From the different sounds from cars squishing of wet shoes water only going up to the spot where you actually got wet. There's a lot of people who are whining about the game not getting campaign DLC. Would it have been nice? Sure! Who doesn't like extra content to their favorite games. HOWEVER for the longest time. When you bought a game that's exactly what you got. Despite that Rockstar did a damn well job with GTA V. It'll go down as one of my favorite games.,"mobile legend, sepuh, gg"

joki Resident Evil,Game seems to have issues with AMD processors. I well exceed the minimum requirements by at least 8 gb in every direction yet the game runs incredibly choppy with FPS lag as low as 20. There isn't a noticable difference in FPS and performance when operating the game at ultra or very low. I still have FPS spikes. The volume needs work as shots echo as if they were passing through a tunnel. The recent patch made a VERY small improvement on my end in terms of performance and has seemed to make it more difficult to find any weapons (6 attempted games after patch and located only 1 AK despite being first in that area). Typically I end up locating a pistol and just getting easy kills on unfortunate players that have a frying pan. This is idiotic and takes away from the fun and the reason why I would play this game. Currently I would reccommend H1Z1 heavily over Battlegrounds mostly due to performance issues and lack of quality gameplay. Save your $30 until they improve the game significantly.,"mobile legend, cecan"

joki PUBG,This game suffers from a wide range of issues HUGE grind as well as a large amount of hackers &amp toxic players. Singleplayer itself is rather alright though it's a bit lacking in activities.I'll focus on some things hurting the game (primarily Online) Possibly one of the most toxic online communities nowadays. Expect people to use the most OP / cheesy ways to kill you including a hitscan RPG. More about that later. Connection issues disconnecting game moving you to a different server and away from your friends you just played with. Very long loading times it's often faster to load into single player and then multiplayer than straight into multiplayer. Also those long loading times continue even after you got into multiplayer and are just hopping between gamemodes heck they don't have to start. All that needs to prompt a load is you accepting an invite into a game lobby (more precisely waiting room) You can't use Steam Overlay when loading because said loading will simply pause. Bad and laggy melee combat system. Hackers. There's lots of them and they have HUGE range of abilities you think an enemy constantly spawning in a jet (which normally takes time to get is very powerful and can be super difficult to take down) is annoying? Well I hope you don't meet hackers who can kick you out of the session or crash your game by spawning dozens of clothes on you. Limited clothes. Rockstar has been improving itself when it came to clothing adding some new models with every larger update (although they still never added the objects available for all three main characters in singleplayer). However those clothes are often of poor texture quality and aren't available in all colours. You like red? Well that's a shame we only have pitch black white brown navy blue camo desert camo forest camo and two hideous mixes. Also don't expect to make your entire outfit match the green you have on your sweater will most likely be different from the one on your cap. Also the game is really strict on what you can wear with what for example you can wear this jacket with these shirts but not with those shirts or you can wear a scarf with pink tanktop but not with black tanktop. Car customization is a bit eeh in the game. Many cars aren't very customizable the best thing you can do in many of them is lengthen the sides by a couple of centimeters. Some cars aren't customizable at all and you can't even put them in your normal garage. Heists are pretty damn boring. They're nothing like in Singleplayer where you have multiple approaches places to set up your escape vehicles et cetera et cetera. In GTA Online heists are pretty much standard missions with some story behind them you don't have a choice in how to go through with the mission. Also if somebody leaves during a heist everyone will drop out. Combine that with the connection issues and you'll see the possible infuriation. At least the stories and cutscenes are fun.. Things are extremely expensive (up to several millions) in order to 'encourage' people to buy Shark Cards AKA cards giving you in game currency for real money. In reality you get little currency for huge amount. You need to grind a lot for money.. or find a hacker who will simply spawn millions for you to pick up. Though you're likely to get banned even if you never intended to pick up any money that the hacker spawned on you. GTA V uses a level (rank) system for its weapons so you'll be able to unlock specific weapons at specific levels. ...Except that they added free widely available DLCs which add the best weapons (stat wise) to purchase with no rank restrictions. There's a complete lack of balance not even an attempt at it. Aside from the aforementioned nonsense with the levels Rockstar started with things like fast bullet proof vehicles and eventually reached explosive bullets which can be applied to a sniper rifle creating a hitscan RPG that I mentioned. Perfect for killing players with one shot to the big toe. Their customer support is infamous for being useless even in really urgent cases like having your account stolen. If they reply to you then their bot will copy paste you a useless response about how bans are permament when you asked for something else. Rockstar releases huge content patches which you need to pay tons of money to get into. CEO update? Pay at least a million for an office then few hundred thousand for a warehouse. You also have to pay for crates which are the main missions in this update. Oh yeah randoms can completely destroy all your progress during the final mission when you sell said crates. They're even encouraged to attack you. The recent Gunrunning upgrade allows you to conduct research in order to get things like weapon mods (including the explosive ammunition for the Hitscan RPG mentioned above). Research takes.. 4 real life hours I believe? You need to be online through it all and you need to keep your supply meter high you either buy those or steal them (AKA do a mission one that takes place in the full lobby so everyone can attack you while you're doing it other players even get a ping to let them know about you!). There are 45 research upgrades that means 7.5 days of playtime. Of course you can speed up the research with sweet $$$ and what better way to get it than with Shark Cards! Oh the research is random too you do not get to pick what you want to get next. Oh yeah Singleplayer doesn't get anything. Not even the many vehicles that appear Online. Rockstar likes to patch stuff! Especially if by 'stuff' I mean harmless glitches that for example allow you to equip a mask with a hat something you can't do normally and yet it looks perfectly fine no clipping or anything. Having lower graphics specifically ones that change the amount of nature puts you at a gigantic advantage. Having said option put to lowest absolutely removes grass which can be rather high in this game leading to situations in which you get headshotted by someone you couldn't see behind it all. There are also some facts like that Rockstar fooled customers by raising the price of GTA V when Steam Summer Sale 2015 started (so the discount it got was equivalent to its standard price of 59 99 ). Not only that they included Shark Cash Card. Said Shark Cash Card gives you in game money. Sounds pretty sweet right? Except that it counts as a redeemed DLC the moment you get it which means that you wouldn't be able to get a refund for GTA V because of it.In 2017 of course there was the fiasco with making mods illegal.All in all singleplayer which I didn't focus a lot on as it's rather okay has a nice story likeable characters although it's lacking in activities and is very unlikely to receive any sort of story enhancing DLCs. Online is terrible imbalanced toxic and Rockstar's greedy attempts at taking more money aren't helping the game as a whole. If you're not sure whether to get it or not ask yourself if you have friends to play with because trying to find yourself in the community will be problematic. Don't get it just for the singleplayer. And don't get it for full price.It's a shame really at its core GTA is a super fun game but everything Rockstar built on top of it only dragged it further down and down.,"cecan, jodoh, wibu"

tutor Bang Bang,I've withheld judgement on Grand Theft Auto V for the most of my gameplay because it's been a rollercoaster for me. Now that I'm basically done with the game I think it's time for me to leave a review. I will be reviewing the Online portion not the story. The story is fantastic and fun to play and I highly recommend you play it if you purchase Grand Theft Auto V. If I'm correct I've played GTA O over the course of three years which have mostly been a delight. I will cherish the memories I have made playing this game with my friends which were fantastic.However most of these memories came from the first few hours of the game. The game is only REALLY fun for the first few levels around up to 40 50 I'd say. The game allows you to explore and learn the game along with immersing yourself into the fictional Los Santos which is quite a large map and a fun adventure. For the first &lt 100 hours the game is truly a new and unique experience.Once you learn all there is to the game however it quickly loses its value. The game becomes not about having fun but earning more money to buy things that allow you to have fun. The heists are monotonous and provide too little compensation for a tedious setup. The MC Clubs / Offices / Bunkers require constant maintenance and need you to consistently work on them every second you get and there's always a risk of it being taken out by griefers who fly by in their Hydras and fire a storm of explosions. The hangars are a joke. The Doomsday Heist is only fun the first time through. The jobs don't pay. The races need expensive cars that cost you 3 000 000 in upgrades.The game obviously doesn't let you earn money as fast as you should be able to. This is to advocate the purchasing of Shark Cards a microtransaction which lets you instantly gain millions of ingame cash. But it doesn't end there. The Shark Cards are heavily overpriced with $100USD netting you a mere 8 000 000 dollars ingame. That's a joke! You can barely afford the most expensive office in the game or buy two/three of most expensive cars. You can't even buy the most expensive item which is a 10 000 000 dollar jet covered in gold paint the normal variant of which is merely a million dollars. You cannot possibly hope to gain any form of actual worth out of these microtransactions which means that it inherently is built to make you buy more and more sinking cash into a scam.Me and my friend beat the system. We've earned millions and millions of money ingame. But now that we've spent all that money on the cool things there's nothing to do. There's nothing rewarding about being rich. You play with your toys then you quickly realise you're just doing the same thing over and over again. I've spent the last 200 hours of my GTA O experience flying around in a jet shooting down anyone who shoots at me. Sure the expansions are fun and I come on each time one comes out but that's only to try them. Once I'm out of money I'm either going to hack it in or just quit the game because it's not worth the grind. Grand Theft Auto Online gave me a great experience. I will always love jumping out of helicopters with my friend to assassinate someone with a bounty and then calling in a car to make a quick escape. But I can't do that anymore. Now it's just rolling up in an APC and blowing them to kingdom come with an automatic missile launcher. Or it's bombing the hell out of them with a rocket powered plane. Or it's strafing them with explosive bullets out of a jet. It's not fun anymore.Except for the stunt races. Those are cool.,"susah, wibu"

joki COD,"The following review has been written during a very early early access.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a battle royale third/first person shooter with a semblance of realism behind it. 100 players enter through a plane and only one two or up to four can leave as a winner. That is honestly all you need to know about the game. There is next to no story and even if there is some backstory it is not needed to enjoy the game at all.Lets start with the good stuff The one map that is in the game is fairly large allowing probably even more than just 100 players to get lost in it. The sound system while glitchy is fairly good for a game of this theme. There are some problems but I will explain those in the cons section. Guns sound pretty well explosions are loud and generally the sound is just about right. Movement options are fairly great. Very reminiscent of ARMA 2. The game is really fun with friends. It has potential.Now the bad stuff Gunplay. While semi realistic most of the guns either feel like they lack any punch or they have way too much punch. From my experience there are numerous occasions of shooting someone several times (lets say 12 times with an AKM) and your opponent is still running around as if nothing really happened. And then you have weapons that touch you anywhere and you explode. Feels like the game would be better if it chose either strong weapons but a lot of cover or weak weapons with movement being the most important thing. Right now the weapon you find tends to dictate whether you are gonna have a good time or not. Not your skill. Map design. While I appreciate how large the map is there is a major problem with it. I hope you like to be sniped out of nowhere because that has been about 90% of all of my deaths in this. Players know which weapons need very little to kill you and since the maps are very elevated and scopes are fairly common most of the time you are gonna just shake your head and wish the game had a damage indicator. Shot recognition. While the sound design is generally great being able to tell where you are being shot from (and we are not talking about silencers) is almost impossible. Quite often the sound can be coming from one direction and you are actually being shot from behind. This has been proven by several video makers and streamers with some of the best headsets on the market. Lack of any tactics. Sniper is king in this game. The moment you find a weapon that can take a scope and the aforementioned scope you become the king of the game. This would be ok if you could in some way make sure you gain these. Usually it is entirely 100% random who gets these and if you do not find one in the first 5 6 minutes of the game you might as well disconnect cause that there is game over for you. There are no defensive measures in the game. No mines no traps. Not to mention even the sneakiest movement still makes so much noise that only a deaf person would be caught off guard by you. RNG. If I say that sniper is king in this game then RNG is the queen. The circles are 100% RNG. You may think you have jumped well gained some gear killed some people and then you notice that the circle has moved far away from you and the way towards it is bound to have at least 10 snipers waiting specifically for you. When it happens once you are miffed but its ok. When it happens ten times in a row you really feel like throwing the computer out of the window. Optimalization. As of writing this review the game is barely playable. There are people who can play the game just fine but majority of people with both bad and good RIGs are having trouble playing this game no matter the settings. Again even video makers and streamers with beasts for computers have reported major problems with optimalization. Lets not even mention constant crashes falling through scenery being blocked by invisible walls etc. Lag. As of writing this review majority of people are having major connection issues. Even people with legit really good broadband. For me for instance it is actually better to play on NA server... while I live in Central Europe. Rubber banding will be the death of thee at least a couple of times. Hit recognition is terrible because many times you unload 5 shotgun shots into someone and they kill you with a couple of pistol bullets because on their end you did not hit them and the servers ""decides"" who was right when it synchronizes. Hackers. Anyone willing to look into the darker corners of the Internet can see the market for the hacking tools for this game bearing major fruit. Why? Because it is an early access game that grew way too quickly for it s own good. Not to mention it is made in an engine that is by my knowledge very easy to hack into. It is sad and all we can hope for is that the developer will find a way how to deal with this menace. Right now it is almost more probable to find a hacker than to find a clean player. Rules. Anyone who puts ""These rules are neither final nor exhaustive we reserve the right to suspend disruptive users even if their behaviour doesn t fall under any of the above rules directly.""Is a fake person who just wants to power mongrel other people. Basically the devs are saying they can ban you for anything even nothing at all. Stay away.TL DRGame has a lot of potential if the developer decides to fix the major issues balance the game a little and add to it. It is currently in Early Access so it should not be a problem. I cannot recommend the game in it s state though I will continue playing it because even through all of it s problems it is a fun game with friends.","waifu, suhu, susah"

tutor FF,I picked this gem up shortly after release. I had no idea there was a predecessor on Playstation 3 Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars. This game is absolutely ridiculous. So ridiculous it has caused me to neglect many other games I have impulsively picked up during Steam sales. This game has been such a problem that I have put in over whopping 400 hours. That is just nuts over 16 days of gaming. In all honesty I love this game. All the various cars you can choose from and all the many possible customization options are dope. This review is way late and the latest update is the Aquadome and crate system. All just awesome. My only gripe is the fact I do not like that the crate keys are about a buck a piece and that you can often get repeat items out of the crates. If there are just a small group of people to play with trading becomes hard and crates build up due to the fact I cannot justify spending money constantly to open items that I will most likely already have. In my honest opinion I believe each key should be about 25 cents with a minimum four pack being a dollar. Just pick it up and play. It is fun. I currently game with an XBone One Elite Controller and use two paddles on the back for ball view and drifting/sliding. Pretty rad.,"pro player, cecan"

The level up system is solid if a bit OP on the survivor side. The problem with this game and it's a big one is the fact that YOU WILL FREEZE UP. In every match. Always. I have frozen up temporarily in every single match I've played as the killer allowing the players to literally dance in front of me while they finish their generator repairs or looting. It's not a connection issue. It's a glitch that occurs when some loser quits a match early. Only the host a.k.a the killer is forced to lock up while the rest of the survivors go about their merry ways. I've lost rare one time use items and all of my points from being forced to quit a match just to end it. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! It should have been tested enough to work these problems out before launch. End of story no excuses. This is poor design and it harkens to the devs being too lazy to hammer out their product. I hope they fix this issue soon but I must recommend that nobody else buys this game without these bugs being fixed. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THIS PROBLEM IS FIXED!,"suhu, cogan"

joki Clash Royale,Best Monster Hunter game for sure. So many quality of life changes that make MH series that much better but lets be clear older MH games are still fantastic! This game just make them easeir to get into than all the past games by a mile. Few weeks in we still have some networking bugs. I have yet to see a crash but I did get the latest video drivers prior to playing so no issues there. Honestly the port to PC in my eyes is fantastic minus the multiplayer issues with disconnects and not being able to connect with friends some times. Highly recommend the game even in its current form. Don't let all the negative reviews disuade you lets face it those people are still playing 5+ hours a day with their negative review because this game is that good. They just want it patched faster!,"pro player, gg"
joki Roblox,It's great to know that a company values money over the satisfaction of their customers (sarcasm). It was a blast to play through the singleplayer mode bacause it offered a cool storyline. What made singleplayer even better was the ability to add mods to the game that basically just continued the game past its storymode whether it be adding cool new cars that the COMMUNITY has taken the time to make or even just messing around with a menu that can change the gravity change the playermodel and do many other things. Recently I have been playing online with my friends and I am just amazed at how each update added to multiplayer includes cars or property that is well over 2 million in game dollars. When you complete all of the heists you can get up to around 3 million as long as it's your first time. That sounds like a lot of cash until you see the reveal of a new update that introduces trucks with guns and supercars that are priced at over 2 mil. Or you could spend your money on some of the new ways to make money through dlc such as exporting cars or gunrunning. Through many weeks of grinding to make money you can finally purchase just one of the things that allow you to purchase something along the lines of a rocket bike. You could easily feel proud of your progress or you could also come to the realization that all of those weeks of grinding gave you absolutely no entertainment but rather just stress. What many people have already done inside of Grand Theft Auto V is cheat in cash online just so they can keep up with the numerous updates. It was understandable that Rockstar has tried their best to remove modders and hackers in ONLINE mode but removing mods in singleplayer? That's just taking it too far. What I have come to realize about this game is that it is fun only if you have money. Call me poor but Rockstar seriously needs to come out with a update that improves the game itself by adding abilities and usefulness of the iFruit phone apps that is of no cost to the player for example the kicking and melee feature in the biker update. We need more updates and less DLC.,gg

The second downside apllies mostly to casual games where you find all those salty players who leave at the very instant when the other team scores a 1 2 or a 0 1.Overall it is a brilliant game with great gameplay mechanics and a mostly very nice community.","pro player, wibu, mobile legend"

joki Roblox,"PUBG玩了快350个小时了 感慨颇深 I have played PUBG for 350 hours and I have lots of things to say.首先 这款游戏的确是好游戏 这一点我们必须承认 我的推荐是给这款游戏的 Firstly this game is really nice we must admit it.IT IS A GOOD GAME.但是现在PUBG的游戏环境实在实在是太差了 But the enviroment of this game is too bad.为什么 因为外挂 但是又不仅仅是因为外挂 Why?Because of those hackers.(But it's not just the bag of hackers).现在 PUBG里外挂已经十分猖獗了 加速 自瞄 透视 无后坐 锁血 甚至是路飞挂 一拳超人挂 Nowadays the hackers in PUBG are very rampant.Speeding up Automatic aiming perspective men no recoil Invincible men and even ""Monkey D Luffy"" hackers ""One Punch Man"" hackers!这些外挂严重破坏了我们的游戏体验 These hackers have destoried our experence of playing.但是我们对此无可奈何 But we have nothing to do about it.诚然 在PUBG里 90 以上的外挂都来自中国 Truely more than 90 hackers are from China in PUBG.虽然我无法代表全体中国人 但是我还是要向各位热爱PUBG的玩家说一声 对不起 Although I can't represent all of Chinese I still want to say to all of you who love PUBG SORRY.在中国 我们将这些开挂的人称为 孤儿 神仙 我真的希望那些孤儿别再做这样的烦人的事情 In China we call the hackers 'orphans' and 'gods' .I really hope those orphans do not do such annoying things in the game.哦对了 我来解释一下 孤儿 ""神仙 这两个词的含义吧 Oh I think I should tell you what's the meaning of them.孤儿象征着我们全体绿色玩家对开挂者的父母的亲切问候 这是在游戏里是一个贬义词 Orphans symbolize the cordial greetings of all us to the parents of those hackers.This is a derogatory word in the game.神仙代表外挂无所不能 在游戏里 'Gods' means they can do everything.(in game)我想让你们明白事是不是所有中国人都是开挂的 也不是所有中国人都进游戏就开始骂 CAO NI MA'的 I hope to let you understand that not every Chinese is hacker and not everyone who is in the game like to say'CAO NI MA' everywhere.虽然从整体上看 我们的素质的确不高 As a whole we do not have a high quality.但是这就是你们听到中文或者被打死就开始喊 曹尼玛中国人 的理由 But is it the reason of you to say 'Fu.ck you Chinese' when you hearing Chinese or be shot by us?????我们是真的很委屈 你们为什么这么做 We are really grieved.Why do you do this??我理解你们被挂打死的心情 但是我们也在被外挂怼啊 I comprehend your mood when you knocked down by hackers but we are shot by them too!现在我认为在PUBG里的有如下的这几种人 以爱国为理由恶意组队的红衣军 外挂 试图诛仙的玩家 骂中国人的玩家 骂外国人的中国人 一脸委屈关掉语音的中国人 起哄高喊 China NO.1""和 Taiwan NO.1""的外国人和事不关己的围观群众 I consider that there are these kinds of people in PUBG the Malicious teams of 'army with red clothes' and they usually use 'loving our country' to be their reason HACKERS players who want to kill 'gods' players who scold the Chinese Chinese who scold the other the Chinese who turn off the phonetics with Injustice faces foreigners booing and shouting ""China NO.1"" and ""Taiwan NO.1"" and a crowd of onlookers.也许大多数人听不懂现在中国人在广场和飞机上到底在说什么 Maybe lots of you can't understand what are Chinese speaking on the squae and the plane.我能给你们举出一些真实的例子 I can tell you some ture examples.谁在那边放歌 关上 Who is playing songs??!Switch off!能听得到么 Can you hear me?来 左右左右站着的是煞笔啊 站着的是煞笔 Come on!Left right left right the standing men are motherf.uc.k.ers.(this is a sentence of a song)机场卖挂 机场卖挂 Sell Sell how to be a hacker in airport sell sell (someone usually say this when he want to go to airport.Oh he must be very low.)是中国人的跳机场 中国人跳机场 紧接着会有一大群中国人开始骂这个喊话的 Flying to school if you are Chinese!Flying to school if you are Chinese!(and Then there will be a large group of Chinese start to scold the speaker.CAO NI MA fu.ck you bi.tch your head is broken?!)总之 希望你们理解 我们也很讨厌红衣军 外挂 我们也希望有一个绿色的游戏环境 All in all I hope you to know we don't like 'army with red clothes' and hackers.We wanna a green game environment.但是直到有一天 我突然看到有人说要锁中国区 steam上甚至出现了呼吁锁区的讨论组 But one day I suddenly find someone saying that please lock Chinese region!!!And there are even some groups appeal for LOCKING REGION???????当时我的心真的拔凉拔凉的 My heart was nearly frozen at that time.啊 的确 是我们不好 是中国的外挂太多了 Oh really.It's our bag there are too many Chinese hackers.但是我能确定一点 一旦锁区 PUBG就会变成第二个H1Z1 But if you do so PUBG will become the second H1Z1.而且外挂的数量肯定会变的更多 And the number of hacker will rise more.他们开得起一天 100的外挂 就用得起一个月 30的VPN They can use the program of hacker which spend them 100 per day they can have 30 per month VPN.而且如果锁区 就会给红衣军正当的理由 And if the region is locked it will give the Red Army a justifiable reason.所以 请不要锁区 这是一个真正热爱PUBG的中国玩家的心声 So please don't lock region this is the heart of a Chinese player who really loves PUBG.我的英语不是很好 我只是个学生 雅思5.0的水平(虽然已经能申请加拿大的大学了 My English is not good I am a student I only get 5.0 in IELTS. Although the mark is enough for me to apply for the university in Canada)如果有错的地方 请原谅我 If there are somthing wrong please forgive me.如果你真的理解我的这篇评测 请帮我顶上去 让更多的人看到这篇评测 If you really understand my review please help it to top up and let more people see this review.哦 还有 虽然我的头像很滑稽 但是我现在超认真的说 Oh what is more though my avatar is very funny I am very serious!!!!!谢谢qwq 233333333 emmmmmmmmmm wwwwwwwwwwwwThank you sir as.s we can","cecan, pro player, mobile legend"

cari Genshin Impact,This game can be quite fun however the fact remains that it is very survivor tailored. Being a killer is like trying to open the worlds toughest pickle jar with your toes. This new ranking system makes pipping incredibly hard for killers as it really hurts you in ways you really can't control. In fact it seems to reward you for camping a survivor which is not fun for either party. It is also worth noting that bugs are incredibly common and rarely fixed. When they are they've been in the game for quite awhile. I rather like this game but it's honestly not worth the time nor the money I invested in it. It's rather sad.,valorant
cari Clash Royale,At first I was angary at this game. Very angary. Until I realized that the point of this new kind of online game is not to be fun but just to keep you playing.Since I have understood this I have simply bought a couple of shark cards and just farm gta$ from my nightclub while my friends go broke. This is my first advice to anyone.Ok now to my review.There are many theories what GTA 5 is. Some say it is the greatest game of all time. I found it is many things at the same time 1. GTA is the best loading screen simulator on the market. Since I own a SSD booting Windows now takes less than 10 seconds. For whatever reason however booting GTA5 takes around 10 minutes and sometimes goes on infinitely. (But the loading screens are updated every couple of seconds and some of them are the nicest you can imagine.)2. GTA is machine to transform lots of your precious time into ugly supercars that look like sanitary rags. (This one is the answer when I apply the scientific method when I just consider what I put in and got out of the system.)3. GTA is a garage space simulator. There are now over 500 cars in the game but you can only have 6 garages so much of your time is spent driving from one to the other. This is actually fun because you must really think hard how the garage system even works when you have 10 cars in all your garages and want to exchange 2 cars (but without being able to take out more than 1 at a time). (Tip the accepted solution is often to drive them in front of the garage and destroy them with a handgranade until you have enough space)4. GTA is consolified popamole with the worst input scheme on the PC ever. Sad but the input on PC makes no sense and almost made me quit the game. I can however guarantee you that after ca 300 hours I had learned the combinations by heart and can now put them in effortlessly like a piano player. Since then it has no longer bothered me.5. Going by the number of disturbed millenials you will encounter it will also be the future cause for a great many broken off university careers suicides and psychotherapy but that's a characteristic of all good games isn't it?6. GTA is a cheaters heaven in which hardly a session passes without a modder placing you in a cage or setting you on fire or some Russian kid with a totally impossible 8000 level terrorizing the whole lobby. (It's kind of helpful though too because if someone is better than you you can just accuse anyone of being a cheater and get away with it.)7. GTA is a futuristic battlefield. This one is funny because everyone expects a game about stealing cars but it's actually a deathmatch arena type game with most people these days using flying motorbikes and armed helicopters and if you want to stand any chance you should at least drive around in an armored tank.Last and most of all GTA will be your new second job! If you want to spend time in a game lots of time then look no further! Everything in this game costs lots of money in order to make money you need to play missions until your index finger will hurt from pressing the W key. In fact even killing yourself costs 500$ in this game!! When you have done missions for some hundred hours (and realize that you earned less than a shnuck) you will realize you need to buy the facilities which cost millions. And then you need more money to upgrade the facilites. And so on.Lastly it's strangely addictive because the graphics engine is one of the best on the PC and the city simulation is pretty darn great (although Rockstar intentionally disabled most features in GTA Online). I also met not only autistic millenials but eventually made some really good friends in this game and overall had a great time.My advice Just don't get angary if someone kills your level 1 character with a rocket salvo from the sky. It happened to all of us and you will get used to it with time and secondly those level 500 players are usually not that good from playing nothing but GTA for the last 5 years and you will soone be able to kill them too.Highly Recommended!,"pro player, sepuh"

If you want realism this is not it period. If you want to play this game solo this game is not for you. If you even want to go on and try to make friends and do stuff with people.... this game is not for you. If you already have a group of friends and want to play the game do stuff together well it might be for you as long as you don't join a full up server.Everything that you do out in the open is flagged for everyone to see which is what makes this game a giant dog turd online. If it was a bit more realistic and you actually had to find the things that were going on ""behind the scenes"" like they should be it would be way better. Hey want to go online and do some drug shipments or maybe deliver some other goods from our warehouses... welp ya can't why? Because everyone on that server sees what you are doing and everyone will gun for you. Every step of the way you are tracked.... hell even just walking around you are flagged... on the map. Who the f*** is this game for other than complete a$$***** no one.The single player is a lot of fun well put together and you can run around in this giant world trying to build an empire... but... you can only do so much. They force you into multiplayer in order to do new content like the biker gangs warehouses and such. I really feel as if they robbed me from content I figured would all be a part of the game. I don't understand how they feel it is all right to publish all of this content and never mention that... by the way... its only in multiplayer. And what I don't get is why? The game has already been killed off by hackers all of the records have been claimed by them billions of dollars have been given away.... but you have to do this stuff online with other people... why?? Why can't me and a few friends get together in private and do them together? and allow everyone to do that? I just don't get it and if you think you have a point to make I haven't thought of you're fooling yourself. I get for races and deathmatch and all that stuff needs to happen online vs other people duhr but all of this new stuff should be allowed in private. You still send that information to them when you do them there is no difference. And why is everything flagged from where people are to shipments running around the map to planes boats people are driving. It makes absolutely no sense and ruins the immersion for me. Single player probably 9/10 multiplayer 1/10 only because it has it.Remember this is my personal opinion I am not looking for fanboys to come flame I've loved gta since the very first this one just misses the mark because they add all of this stuff and it is just something I'll never be able to see.

joki Cyberpunk,This is probably the game that has given me most for my money and I don't see myself ever deleting it off my computer. Moreover everyone of my friends who have tried it became hooked. They are always constantly updating the game with free content and it 0% pay to win. There's absolutely no advantage gained by purchasing the DLCs and the trading options makes it so that one can simply trade crates for the stuff one craves to pimp the rides up. What surprises me the most is the fact that I completely suck at this game despite over 600 hrs of playtime and yet I love it. I recommend that you give it a try there's always the refund option if it's not your flavour.10/10 no doubt.,cecan

The thing I found fun in this game was trying to find my friends in this huge map it was extremely fun. I kept running into strangers who would sometimes give me stuff or attack me and take my stuff. Once I found my friends then the fun really kicked in. We ran around found some towns that were radiated and looted the buildings for some top notch items. The game is constantly updating with new stuff and I think I will keep playing this game even when the game fully releases. I highly recommend this for people who like survival games that aren't over the top realistic like DayZ.,cogan

The weapons all feel very different from each other with the esceptions of a few pistols the recoil is very easy to control and every kill you get feels very satisfying.

The only parts that are noticibly buggy are landing around many buildings/trees or trying to pick items up using the pickup key and not the inventory.

Let me tell you most of them were already using hacks that were written on C++ &amp not through the modding tool which the game also had an update to disable any modded clients from entering GTA O months prior to the t done from T2 Interactive &amp Rockstar Games.You ed up Rockstar/T2 you and off with any new product that's in any form related with you.

The real gameplay excluding the bugs is what makes this game stand out in BR scene it has a lot of depth (plenty of things you can do with different tactics smokes hearing other people staying in the shadows etc.) in my opinion close to a perfect combat system (can't even compare it with h1z1) and these are the things that I consider high end priorities for such game.,"suhu, waifu, cewek"

Worst part about this game is the community. If you build a base in a public server you better expect it to be looted and/or destroyed when you come back to the game.If you like pvp (and many do) then there are tons of massively popular pvp servers. But if you want to survive you better have a group of friends also playing. Or at the very least join a group already established on the server. Trying to go alone is guaranteed suicide.,"suhu, cewek, pro player"
tutor Genshin Impact,Don't let the negative reviews of potential cheaters and game breakers fool you this is an excellent game. Everything about it is smooth immersive and engaging. There's more content than you can shake a stick at and hundreds and hundreds of hours worth of gameplay to enjoy whether in story mode or playing online. People are upset because the game developers want people to play the game as intended instead of changing it drastically for entertainment purposes. Look at what OpenIV has done they changed the game SO much that now there are hundreds of people bad mouthing the game simply because they can't modify the game to their liking anymore. If OpenIV hadn't come along and tarnished an otherwise flawless product GTA V would still be a gleaming example of what a game should be. Instead it is losing players and the reputation of GTA V is being damaged beyond repair. Here's a big **** You to OpenIV for causing this.Sincerely A True Gamer,pro player

Even the bugs in the game added a little bit of charm to the game.However the devs somehow managed to shoot themselves in the foot over and over and over again. They constantly add new features that nobody asked for while neglecting to fix game breaking bugs that have been in the game since day one. This game is an unoptimized ugly choppy broken mess that I could maybe justify playing if it was free.As is this game has no redeeming qualities and shows no signs of improving.

joki ML,As a long time fan of the GTA series and owning the entire series the beginning of the story was fun but halfway through changing characters gets a little annoying. Being a bank robber is different than being a gangster or mobster like the others in the series but was a fun change.over all after beating the game twice I have to say the game was fun but I was wanting a bit more with single player dlc. The online portion was similar to the story. At first it was fun but once you get all of the jobs(CEO making fake money making drugs having a MC etc) it literally becomes the same missions over and over again. Not only that but rockstar made it that you get very little money from doing these jobs forcing you to buy shark cards or play the game like world of Warcraft.which at first sounds fun and resonable but in practice becomes boring and a grind fest(since your doing the same missions over and over). Overall I would get it for single player and mods absolutely fun. But I wouldn't get it JUST for the online even with friends too much of a grind without the fun of being a traditional mmo.,"wibu, pro player"

cari Cyberpunk,The game has a lot of crashing issues on the latest NVIDIA GPU drivers and even bluescreened my PC once. The game crashed 6 times on the opening sequence alone and I kept on trying to get it to work. After a lot of struggling I managed to get past the opening but the game still crashes in the middle of the first mission that you are given and that is on top of the game has some pretty severe performance issues like stuttering and low FPS even on my midrange hardware.There is also a lack of options to disable motion blur and mouse smoothing and there's no option for ultrawides so for those who are picky about that too I'd steer clear.This port is pretty bad. A shame since the engine's (that they used) previous versions ran significantly better since there's no other way to play this game than on consoles (Where it runs worse) and that I had a bit of fun despite the large sums of crashes and issues.This is why you should never preorder AAA games. Hopefully since Devil May Cry 5 is targeting 60FPS on consoles the PC version will fare much better.,gg

tutor Cyberpunk,((Updated))They're working on bringing back OpenIV stop giving good games a bad rep (I've even seen this on Kerbal Space Program). Leaving a bunch of bad reviews wont do all. Especially when you do it on games that have nothing to do with GTA 5. Grow up. The singleplayer is good multiplayer is a bit grindy but with a couple heists you can get most of the stuff unlocked (content wise like CEO/Biker stuff). Not going to give everyone a bad name but there are alot of people leaving bad reviews just because they can't use OpenIV to cheat in multiplayer anymore. Those that are doing it because of singleplayer mods I get it. But at least keep your ing and moaning to the game in question. Spreading it to games that Take Two has even barely breathed on (KSP for example) is hurting nobody but those developers. TL DR ignore the negative reviews about OpenIV but dont buy it unless it's 50% off or better.,"susah, sepuh, gg"

Why is it that I have the fear of gettingbanned for no reason while all the other hackers can easily roam freely without a carein the world? I think that there should be special servers for modding withoutupsetting those who want to play the game legit. Overall Online mode is fun butthere is a fear of getting banned for playing the game the way the creatorswant you to. I will keep playing this game but it is not right that R* is doingnothing about this problem.6/10,"valorant, gg, susah"
tutor PUBG,Basically an unfinished slot machine,"pro player, susah"
tutor Cyberpunk,I say this is a really good game. Its fun to play with friends but also fun by yourself too. I would reccommend duos as it is my favorite game mode because you don't have to worry about too many people shooting you but you also get in some pretty intense firefights. I played with a 1060 3gb and the game ran great. The developers update this game constantly and do really good stuff with the game to make it more fun and enjoyable. It takes just a few hours to get used to the game play and then after that its super fun getting kills and those chicken dinners.,"suhu, valorant"

tutor GTA,Product received for free. esse jogo e muito bom para vc passar o tempo mas ele é muito limitado pois quem não tiver um computador intermediario não vai conseguir rodar.Mas deixando isso de lado o jogo tem uma balistica e Fisica realista como por exemplo (BulletDrop BulletTravel e ETC) o que torna o jogo mais realista e dificil. porem recentemente depois da atualização 1.0 chegou muitos Cheaters (Trpaceiros hacks) que deixou o jogo não jogavel raramente eu caiu em um lobby sem Hack. enfim como eu vi que tera um patch que arrumara os problemas de cheat eu vi outros problemas como por exemplo os Asiaticos em geral fazendo time o que torna o jogo literamente não jogavel.fora isso o jogo vem evoluindo desde junho do ano passado (a epoca que eu comprei o jogo) antes o jogo era mal otimizado e agora a empresa esta lutando para que isso não aconteça e isso é legal porem como eu sei que isso vai ser uma epoca do jogo entao minha analise e positiva,waifu

tutor Cyberpunk,"This game is one of the most fun games I've played in a long time. Solo is fun but playing Duo (with one other friend) and Squads (with two or more friends) is the best. Had issues at the start with a ""Network Lag Detected"" error where it kicked me from games and would take a few minutes to rejoin However once I fixed this issue the game has been a blast. Yeah you'll die a lot. You probably won't get a chicken dinner on your first run but for some reason I still enjoy spawning looting killing and dying over and over again. For an early access game this is fantastic! Now let's just hope the developers actually push it out of early access unlike most games.",mobile legend

joki Cyberpunk,Amazing game to play but if you have a short temper I would not recommend this game for you. If you are lucky you can find some small servers with all friendly people who help out. But if not you're most likely to get stoned to death or shot to death. Very realistic it is like a revamped minecraft. My tips to you is that if you don't want to be killed don't kill other people to give them a reason to do the same.Edit 12/26/14After they released the new version of Rust it has gone downhill.Edit 2/22/15The new version is actually now becoming pretty damn good. A few more major updates and it might be as good as legacy.Edit 4/24/15The new version has gotten very fun. It still has some performance issues but changing the settings fixes that.Edit 11/28/16Just doing this to get a badge.Edit 3/3/18This game is trash.,valorant

cari FF,I have completed the game to 100% I've got every possible item unlocked all tofus and got the best rankings in the game. My only advice is for people who are worried about not having enough content there is definitely enough to enjoy the game many many times. You cannot compare the scale of this to an online shooter or a sandbox RPG because it's nothing like those games. The value of this game is the same as when you play a story driven single player that you binge for a while and if you like it enough (like most fans) you'll go back to the game later simply because you love the game not because theres more to do. Anyone who says the game is too hard or the controls are difficult to master go play minecraft or get better( I died loads of times).,"gg, susah"

joki NINTENDO,This is my first review. Why? Because this game is that much fun! You should know! I play online multi player games exclusively like Overwatch Smite LoL Faeria Hearthstone Battlerite. But Rocket League is the easiest pick of all my games when I don't know which one to choose. I think I've had the most fun with Rocket League aswell. Sure when you get to Gold from silver standards there's Aerials all over the place and it's way more competitive. It can become frustrating if you play too much. But you'll always come back to it with a smile. Make sure you read atleast some other reviews here. This game is on a league of its own. It also helps there's way over 150 thousand people online huge tournaments ect. Unlike faeria which is the best card game but has like 250 people... 150 thousand means you'll always find people of your skill level. Easily!This game is like a sport on steroids. With all kinds of different tricks you can pull off with boost more boost! I'll only score the gameplay. 9.9/10 compared to todays standard. Have fun playing rocket league! Because you will!,jodoh

joki NINTENDO,I originally couldn't play due to bugs and crashing and started with a negative review that I said I would update once it would play consistently enough. At first it was the refresh rate setting in game causing constant crashes. Since I have a 120 hz monitor i set it to that in game but it kept crashing. When I tried leaving it at 60hz or 99 hz the inital crashing stopped. Then i started getting intermittent ERR_GFX_D3D_INIT crashes to desktop sometimes combined with nvlddmkm error telling me to reboot or reinstall the game every 10 minutes to 2 hours. Also I was seeing a lot of screen tearing with or without v sync no difference. After looking around for troubleshooting advice I found a solution that worked for me here https //www.youtube.com/watch?v TjEQmZrRmtEIt turns out that some cards' max boost clocks don't match the standard boost value being reported. Since I adjusted the values low enough I've been playing crash free for 15 hours or so.Now that I have been able to enjoy the game a bit it's turning out to be a real work of gaming art. Plenty of memes humor subtlety action variety graphics and so on. Can't wait to see how it develops.,cogan

joki ML,I would like to start by saying that I discovered Rocket League this year but it quickly became one of my favourite game. It's such a good game to play with friends ( I can't really recommend it without them). The mechanics are not the easiest to learn and there will be times when a team comes and just destroys you but believe me it makes the game more fun.The soundtrack of is good and it gives rhythm to the game and even though I usually don't listen to this type of games I can enjoy it while playing.The graphics of the game are good normal I would say they are not jaw dropping but neither unplayable.The microtransactions are there but they don't really influence the game maybe there are a few cars with better hit boxes but the difference won't mean much on a lower level.I can't really find any cons so I'm going to give a 9/10 ( it just needs a little bit more to become a perfect Game).,"gg, waifu"

Very few people are actually friendly outright and most are constantly skeptical. But something about the constant bickering is endearing. This game has a lot of heart and has certainly come a long way since a year ago. The dev team for this game are easily the most dedicated Early Access devs I've ever seen. Bi weekly content updates listening to the community about bugs/greivances and solid game design. This is the holy trinity and they nail it. My only critique would be the lack of PvE elements trying to kill you. Sure the thudding of a bear can be terrifying if you aren't prepared to fight it but its not enough. Players need something to be scared of other than each other so that more focus can go to the environment. Lastly removing visibility during the night was an interesting move but it makes half the time spent in game almost useless without using a light source. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but it would be nice if we could have night vision goggles as a super rare drop/craft. Might be asking for too much but it would certainly help.Anyway excellent game. 9/10. Definitely worth the money.,"mobile legend, cecan, wibu"
cari Resident Evil,it is a realy fun game you should try it. takes up to 1 min to get in a game but it is worth it. at 14.99 it is worth it buy it,cogan

tutor Destiny,Update November 2018 Although this game is still far from polished it has come a long way since Early Access. It has a good mix of MilSim action and Battle Royale adrenaline. Some terrain (boulders and rocks in particular) could use hitbox updating Erangel could use some loot buffs and I would like to see pistols buffed but these are minor complaints. The gameplay is still solid and I keep coming back to this game!(It is also possible I wrote this review to get a badge but don't let that stop you from trying out the game),suhu

joki ML,It's a rusty world out there... die or die tryin!,"pro player, cecan"
tutor ML,While the idea behind Rust is very good and very nice and worth the $20 the game itself comes nowhere close to that. Admittedly I just started playing a month ago or so but still. Maybe it was good back then but I can tell you it is not good now. Any of the servers that you are gonna get on you know as a starter (so the noob ones or beginner only ones) are all filled with dummies like you gettiing absolutely nothing done. The blind are just leading the blind to nowhere good. The best part about these servers are when you pick a fight against a dude with a rock while you have a spear. 10/10 gameplay. I know that there are many videos and documents that tell you how to play but not to seem like I'm a TL DR sort of guy it ruins the fun to study something just so that you can play it. If you want to just hop right in and have so much fun with the people in the newest server well then this game is not for you. While I am sure that many people will love this game if you want to jump right into a game don't want to be doing nothing the first hour or two want to not get pummeled by people most obviously better than you want to not get left behind by bozos that won't help you for the same reason you won't study the gameplay mechanics to the core so you can get anything or just want your computer to not take 10 years or so to get into one single server then this game just isn't for you. It's not for me and that's why it gets a bad review. (,"cewek, sepuh, mobile legend"

Only slight annoyance is the story missions revolve around telling your friend to wait till the cut scene is over before letting them join don't quite get why they couldn't go the route of forcing all players to watch it/skip it but it will only plague the first few hours of the game and even then it is not as big a deal as everyone makes it out to be.

joki ML,Long time MH fan started with Tri and then ended up playing every English version other than the OG Playstation one and also dabbled in MHO. I have to start by saying that the quality of life aspects alone make this game AMAZING to play. Things are so much simpler to do now. Wanna gather that plant? Good just grab it while you are walking past it DONE. The removal of paintballs is also rather welcome IMO. Many of these reviews that are negative will point out the connection issues I will say that as far as I can tell since the recent patch these issues are FIXED. Game runs great even on rigs and the fact that you can have monster hunter and freedom of control is just amazing. Keyboard and mouse controls are great once you change them from the wack defaults.If you are a long time MH fan then GET IT hands down. If this is your first MH game then GET IT. Long time fans will appreciate quality of life things that have been done newbs will appreciate just how ing awesome the game is. My only note is that THIS IS A GRINDY GAME. If that is not your thing maybe don't get it unless you just wanna play through the story and be done cause realistically the story is 10% of the real game which is all the end game grind be it for decos or gearsets or w/e you like.,"gg, waifu, free fire"

tutor FF,"I was just reading some of the reviews for the game. front page reviews were all negative just because rockstar avoided reducing the price during summer sale by throwing in Multiplayer money. They need to review the game for what it actually is not because of what could be considered a ""bad buisness practice"" (most $60 dont even go on sale anyways so dont blame rockstar for taking the same road and trying to throw in extra in game money). The game itself is great. i dont want to go into an in depth review but i would suggest watching the angry joe review or a credible reviewer give their take not some random plebs who dont even talk about how the game actually playes.","gg, cogan, free fire"

tutor Bang Bang,All this time and the game is still a buggy piece of crap. It's fun when it works but that happens so rarely I find it hard to want to play again. Constant stutters and frame drops make the game unplayable at times. Quite often I find my teammates in the plane but I'm not since the game hasn't loaded for me yet. Some textures don't load until a minute after I've dropped. Just before writing this review a played a match with my friend where it wouldn't let me pick anything up. I could walk around I saw my friend picking stuff up. Turns out my character was still in the plane. This wasn't due to my internet since I had no lag while walking around and watching my friend. I paid $30 for this after the full release and hoped that I would get a finished game. Sadly that wasn't the case.,"cecan, free fire, susah"

joki Destiny,Product received for free. alright first of all let me say this game is a classic and one many rpg players or gamers in general will never forget me included but does this remaster live up to the hype? yes and noI cant really complain about wasting money because I got it for free alongside the other people with all the DLC i digress what i mean by no is the pc players specifically the modded players. I myself played around 430 hours of always 100+ mods and it was amazing i loved the game skyrim base and with mods the entire experience kicks off but any modded player will tell you skyrim just isnt as good without mods the graphics cant compare some followers e.g. Sofia are far superior and much more. And i completely agree I would never play skyrim vanilla vs skyrim modded if i had the choice. and its just the vanilla vs modded experience is heavily one sided on the mod side so theres no point instantly upgrading unless you yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods.but what i mean by yes is in about 2 3 months if enbs are supported and the modders of skyrim port their mods into the new game as many are already itll be faaaaaaaaar better because of bethesda fixing some bugs and the new 64bit engine and the scripts (although when it comes out you should 100% swap to skse se because its far far far superior and many mods require it e.g skyui) so when everything gets updated and ported it should be a far superior experience compared to 2011 skyrim.overall i most likely wont be playing the game for a while at least until skse or skyui somehow is supported for the new game. But when those mods are ported and availible for the game? ill be playing like its 2011 again im really excited for the remastered mods but a remaster of the actual game? didnt need it it wouldve been nicer to see a full new fresh remaster of oblivion or morrowind instead. so in conclusion theres no point instantly upgrading unless you yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods. However if you just want to play the game without mods go ahead and play its just a better skyrim for you but if you want mods youre gonna have to wait until skse se releases but when it does ill be playing it for sure alongside of many other people,"free fire, valorant"

tutor Roblox,"This game is complete trash. Honestly I'm still wondering how the they actually thought this game was ""ready"" when it was ""offically"" released back in Dec 21 2017 with the 1.0 update. They are some scumbags honestly. Game keeps crashing frequently and it hasn't been all this way when I first brought the game back in March I believe. Now whenever I load into the game it takes forever and by the time it does load I'm at the end of the plane route whereas my teammates have already jump in some other area that I am half across the map from. Ever since the recent updates I feel like with every ""patch"" or update the game continues to progress in a poorly optimized setting for their game and it's really sad. The game has almost been fully released in almost a year now and it's still this ""Fix PUBG"" is a joke as of right now the recent ""fixes"" they put out only gets worse and worse for me. I really hope by the time they finshed with all the fixes they promised us in their Fixed PUBG website is true and they would continue to patch this game up but as of right now don't but this game until they fixed all the damn bugs desync and optimized this damn game. I only play this game because I have hope that this game could be the best it can be in the spam of 3 months of fixes from the devs.","mobile legend, suhu, cewek"

joki Genshin Impact,This truly is an amazing game. The graphics are absolutely stunning and the mechanics are so well thought out and made. I have around 61 hours on the game but I've only had it for about a month and can only play on weekends. The community isn't as toxic as most people say. I have logged on to multiple servers as a naked and was given a base and multiple full gear sets. Some people are rude but I believe that that's the entire purpose of the game. It was made so people could survive and fight and not so everyone could sit around and gather resources. It just came out of early access and I know that the only place this game can go is straight to the top. Highly reccomend it. 9.5/10,"suhu, mobile legend"

joki ML,Their is many things wrong about this game. One building is if you want to destroy a wall its essintially impossible and if you misplace an object oh well that object is gone. If you lost your keys from someone and you are trapped in your house with no resources welp you just have to break a wall to get out. Also the community is . I was about done with this game so i decided how about i give my house to someone if they did not kill me but no they just would rather kill someone who has nothing than go to a house with guns turrents chests full of loot and food. Also if you want to make a team that probably wont happen because 99% of the people their would kill you immediatly even if you have no loot at all. Its more of a deathmatch than a survival game. Also this game has been out for five ing years and its still alpha wtf. Oh and also if you dont want to play a deathmatch game and play a singleplayer rust well basically thats since the only enemys are bears and wolves which dont really harm you if you have a sleeping bag nearby. This game would be so good if people dont try to instantly kill you everytime you see them. When I play a survival game I want a game were people try to make friends and work together not just player on their computer killing eachother for absolutly no reason. Overall the game is great without the people and the building part but since the game is basically a multiplayer game its because of the community.,"free fire, pro player, mobile legend"

cari COD,A Rimworld Tale... Our escape pods crash landed on a tropical Rimworld. Just Doc Miss Farmer and Chef on a strange world.We gathered what resources we could from the wreckage and slept the night rough on the floor of a cave.The next day we started building a lavish stronghold before planting a few crops.Before we knew it the rations we scavenged were gone (should have planted crops first). So we were forced to hunt the local wildlife for food.A cry for help came over the radio. It was Doc's sister Princess she'd also survived planet fall and was being chased by raiders!We set out in force and rescue her and bring her back to the fortress. We celebrate with a hearty meal of our first crop.It turns out that Chef is a nudist. In a bid to make her more comfortable we let her spend her days o'natural. Everyone is fine with it.Our home of Fort Haven is finally finished and we start researching upgrades. Chef makes a statue of her self striding around in the nude and we use it to decorate the guest room.Another escape pod crashes down. We rescue the occupant some guy called Aiki. He's a junkie with violent tendencies.We patch up his wounds give him a hot meal and send him on his way.Both Doc and Princess catch plague! I bet it was that space junkie. They're instantly confined to bed.It take some doing but Doc treats Princess and Princess treats him.Raiders attack with half our crew bedridden with disease. We push them back but Chef is badly injured.Miss Farmer carries her back to Fort Haven and heals her wounds.Through sibling compassion and their medical know how Doc and Princess survive the plague and Chef is also restored to full health.Realising how vulnerable we are we start building defensive gun turrets. We need more metal so everyone heads off to mine.Princess doesn't like mining and for some reason she snaps. She runs around setting fires all over the place.Doc and Farmer knock her out and put her to bed but not before the fires spread taking out a huge section of forest to the North.A huge army of raiders attack. Perhaps they saw the fires? The attack our walls and devastating most of our crops. The new gun turrets come online and we mow them down.With our crops in a bad way and our food supplies low Chef recommends eating the would be raiders...A fun game. Would crash onto a Rimworld and eat man flesh again...,"cogan, gg"
