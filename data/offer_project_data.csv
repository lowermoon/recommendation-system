Because giving the power of unlinking your steam account to the customer is too much to handle and would give them a god complex. YOU ruined my day/week.,Jessica Hester

Replayability is great considering this is a competitive game but the actual content is actually few and far between.Recently can't play it without using VPN.

Solid 50 fps (On low settings XD) Now being able to properly play PUBG I can say its safe to say that this has a special ""feel"" to it. It's almost like a horror game that you pour hours into and when you end up dying in the end of it all you litterally scream in terror. I love this game.

joki tree,Good game. Simplicity is it's strength. I cannot support any game which one pays full price in beta and then they start to roll out microtransactions. It's very disingenuous of a publisher to say it's a one time thing to pay for a competition and they need the money when a small team has made over 100M gross. Say no to microtransactions from the start otherwise every aspect of the game will be monetised. We start with cosmetic skins for a one time event in summer 2017 summer 2018 we'll have paid drops which only contain top tier weapons and specials.Say no to monetisation and microtransactions from the start.

joki near,There s nothing new I can say that hasn t been said about this amazing installment in the Resident Evil series. I am a huge fan of the original RE2 and this game exceeded my expectations. The environment alone was enough to creep me out. The zombie sounds and models are terrifying and damn Mr. X is here only to give heart attacks. All in all I give this game a 10/10 and I can t wait to see if Capcom can do RE3 and Code Veronica X the same amount of Justice this remake has made for a classic and timeless game. Heck I wouldn t mind a RE1 and RE0 remake now made similar to 2!,Robert Thompson

cari discuss,"Monster Hunter World is the latest iteration in the Monster Hunter series. I've played since Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate for the 3ds and have loved it since. If you enjoy killing monsters with lots of different weapons and weapon types try it out.+ Pros Just like any other Monster Hunter game before it. It has a wide variety of monsters to kill Weapons got an upgrade. Each weapon type now has something new with it (insect glaive can dash in the air dual blades has archdemon mode now etc.) Graphics got a BIG upgrade. No more PS2 looking graphics that's for sure. Never minded the graphics before but seeing this it brings a tear to my eye. Story got a buff. Like with Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate they added a tiny bit more to the story. Still the same general ""Elder Dragon X does stuff and we gotta stop it but there's more"" but it has more of a... depth? Length? One of those.+ Cons Initially came out with connection issues. Annoying to play with friends then get disconnected mid quest. It's since been fixed. There was a chance that killing the final main mission monster Xeno'Jiiva would corrput your save file during the credits. Make sure to make a backup beforehand! Teostra has some frame rate drops with his blast. Hopefully that gets fixed soon. Decoration RNG can be very unforgiving at times. When you just want one antipara and you get 8 antidote I die a little inside.All in all if you've played Monster Hunter before you will enjoy this game a lot. If you haven't give it a shot! If you like killing large monsters and lots of customization this game will suck you into a warm blanket of grinding with frustration that monster X just killed you because you FORGOT TO EAT AT THE CANTEEN FOR THE BUFFS!!!",Jerry Atkinson

cari thing,Do you like soccer? What about cars? What about rockets? If you answered yes to two of these things then guess what... FUN is abound. Rocket League combines the competitive nature of soccer the speed of rockets and cars into a simply elegant and yet wonderful game. The mechanics are wonderous the community is super chill and fun to play with and the gameplay can certain keep you entertained for hours upon hours. Simply said for those who don't get it.... BUY THIS GAME NOW! You will never regret it. And if you do... what the hell if wrong with you.10/10 Would shutdown enemy team again as dat goalie,Jessica Morgan
cari realize,This game is one of the most bugged games ever to come out i think BLUUHOLE SHOULD RENAME ITS STUDIO BLUEBALLS AND SHOULD GIVE EVERYONE REFUNDS ITS T AND THEY DONT FIX THE BUGS INSTEAD THEY ADD A LAGGIER VERSION OF THE GAME ONTO THERE TEST SERVER IT SO GAY DONT BUY AND IF U DID BUY IT ASK FOR REFUND GIVE A NEGATIVE REVIEW AND PLAY FORTNITE BLUEBALLS!!!!,Nicolas Morris Jr.

joki pressure,"Gone from being something fun to an utter cash grab. Brand new cars with a 1 mph advantage over the previous one costs $30 to buy if bought with real cash. Rehashing and adding new game modes apprently the same game mode in 8 different locations counts as ""tons of new missions"". All the player made missions are either rubbish or just wall ride races around the same stretches of the city. The original missions and heists are fantastic but none more have been added since Online launched. The hacking is horrendous a few nice guys occasionally drop cash but most just grief and can actually crash your system.The game has horrendous network connectivity issues and issues with it not being hosted on servers clearly they didn't learn from GTA IV online.Overall a shame the charm humour and sociopolitical commentary of GTA games shines through but clearly the Rockstar bean counters want to wrangle cash from what could be a great game.",Susan Ellison

cari adult,In these almost 50 hours I've spent in this game I have yet to face any server/queue/matchmaking issues and perhaps like 95% of the time was spent actually playing the game so that's definitely a positive start. Regarding actual gameplay there are a lot of bugs I can't deny that however they're minor and have no impact on the ability to play the game and enjoy the core idea of this game. The real gameplay excluding the bugs is what makes this game stand out in BR scene it has a lot of depth (plenty of things you can do with different tactics smokes hearing other people staying in the shadows etc.) in my opinion close to a perfect combat system (can't even compare it with h1z1) and these are the things that I consider high end priorities for such game.,Vanessa Austin

cari race,It has everything you'd think this game should have. The custom matches don't work yet but this game is still in beta. When it becomes available. I'd like a setting to allow the map's alphabetical boxes that grid the map as you look at it to become randomly filled with the blue circle thing instead of the blue circle thing restricting you to a defined region that you have to run your *** off to get to. It would make it more like Battle Royale the movie. Since that's what they do in the movie. They marked the maps to regions that were 'locked' and anyone inside of it would die off if they remained in it. This would give the online battles more longevity for those who like to have things feel a bit more campy. Plus it would make it easier for beginner players to survive longer.Also maybe opening up the workshop would be nice to have some custom weapons and armor and clothing etc. Although the grid blue box thing would be the only thing I'd want more out of anything else.I am not sure what else I thought might be nice for this game. Although that's all. I will return and fix this review when I've thought of more stuff. Otherwise It's a great game and I can see why people play it so often. Worth checking out for an hour. Incase your unsure.P.S It would be nice to have a feature where we can see who we've played with in the past few games. Like Xbox does. So we can friend ppl when we've forgotten to afterwards.,Bryan Huber

cari road,So i have played a little over 300 hours on this game not a heap but enough to have a decent opinion on the game. The problem with this game is the more you play the worse it gets. Not much point selecting a specific server when they're all full of chinese anyway. This game started off as a pretty well received game and even though it had lots of glitches in early access lots of them were fixed. However this game was rushed to a version 1.0 release and rushed to be released on console. The game is now full of hackers and laggy servers. The developers no longer care about actual gameplay and instead release 6 gig updates entirely based on cosmetics and tiny bug fixes. This game is currently a horribly optimized mess and i would avoid buying it.If your looking for a battle royale game i would suggest playing either Islands of nyne or Escape from Tarkov they are well balanced have dedicated spray patterns and can easily maintain a stable framerate they also constantly receive new content from the developer and bug fixes as well as not being plagued by hackers.Edit 1 Wow what do you know i'm still playing this heap of game i've played another 250 hours since i wrote this review and if i'm being completely honest the game has not improved. The physics engine in this game is so broken you can literally drive over a bump at 10 km/h and end up doing 4 backflips and blowing up. And the game run so badly still how has this not been fixed?I mean how do you even manage to lower the optimisation of the game with every update? Also who thought the event pass was a good idea??? Nice job B team.,John Gallagher
tutor customer,,Javier Wilson
joki budget,Simple answer is this game is not fun. Long answer is that I can see why people like this game. It really draws you in and gives you the urge to keep playing. You spend 30 minutes running around trying to find better items. The last 10 minutes of a match you spend trying to dodge the oddest firearm controls I have ever seen in a game. As an example I just finished a round where the player who killed me first nearly blind fired a sniper rifle at me and hit then pulls out his M4 with a holographic sight and proceeds to just lob bullets at me killing me. The match before that I was toe to toe with an enemy. On my screen I unloaded an entire magazine into him he ended up killing me. Upon watching the replay it showed I didn't make a single dent in his heath. Ultimately this is my biggest issue with this game. The gun mechanics do not make any sense and are not natural. The graphics are nice but I have had instances where because my graphic settings are different from other players they may not see the vegetation I am hiding in so to them I am just crouched in the middle of a field. The network backend always has some form of lag in it and constantly throws error messages saying it couldn't connect. Other than that the game is solid. Looking at other players feedback it seems I am not the only person to feel this way. If it is on sale I say go for it but I wouldn't pay full price for it again.,Lauren Jackson

tutor half,I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!I did not buy it on release because my excitement was building up too much and I felt if I bought it at the time I might have died as my heart would have exploded because of the sheer excitement. Now I'm thinking what the actual fuc* is this I'm not a retard in understanding it's soccer (get triggered deal with it) but with cars. I'm literally getting rammed up the back end getting hit on the side (weren't supposed to sound sexual) and blown up into pieces. Everytime I am hit it's like my black self goes back into the slavery period and getting whipped uncontrollably. The cars are crap I've got a fast car and my opponent has a big truck you would be thinking that I should win the race to the ball everytime. NOPE not in this fuc*ing game the big truck always wins this game is a mess surely the developers went to school to learn about physics regarding weights? Oh don't forget the new 'added' features that are free you now get fuc*ing crates that are rewarded which you then have to spend 1.19 on a key to unlock a crap decal or a new hat. I'm playing a car football game not pimp my ride. I would like to add shooting pace and skill attributes to my professional car not change the wheels to look cool and pull some birds in my whip and taking them to Mcdonalds for a 99p hamburger. Then the team mates you get put with on the game they are window lickers and play as if they're playing the game with their feet. Always get team mates that score a remarkable own goal that only themselves could score because of how fuc*ing sh* they are at the game.. Whenever I try to score a goal the ball bounces about 12 million times hitting the post crossbar cars floor ceiling before the magnet out of no where attracts the ball into my own goal and the opponent winning because of BS.I would rather watch the Super Bowl LI again where it took over 4 hours for the game to finish when it should have finished in 1 hour it's ridiculous how it's classed as a sport Golf goes a faster pace than American Football. Anyway back to the review the game is trash just literally caked in shi* and I feel ripped off everytime I play it. Get some toy cars and a bouncy ball and you've replicated Rocket League. I'm pretty sure I discovered this game when I was about 5 years old I was just too young to copyright the game well I've got photo evidence of me playing the same concept so be prepared to get sued Psyonix.,Joshua Brewer

joki policy,The content releases have been GREAT! The downside is that Rockstar / Take Two are massively cashing in on in game micro transactions. This has made all the new fun content nearly inaccessible. It's a shame that they seemingly designed the game around those shark cards. With the addition of the recent backlash from the modding community it has brought this game down from an all time favorite to something rather dissapointing. The game could have still been great... but it left me with a bitter taste and I wouldn't recommend it anymore.,Patrick Garcia

cari interest,If you're into realistic military shooters you'll want to add this game to the list.If you're coming from H1Z1 or are new to this type of game I still recommend trying it but made a pros/cons list in case you're on the fence about it.PROSThe Weapons They feel and sound great to use. Large variety that are all impactful in different scenarios.Game Tempo A great mix between downtime/intense ramp up and blood boiling firefights. Sound Great sound design! Learn to pay attention to receiving and making sound from footsteps gunfire vehicles etc.Tactics/Strategy Decision Making at every turn. Hint Its different every time!Co op Unrivaled team play! Team up with a friend or 3 for some good times.CONSEarly Access Expect lower FPS server lag random bugs.Pistols Near useless except for the first minute of the game.Cheaters Not game breaking since the games are relatively short (5 20 mins). But they're there.Luck of the Draw This isn't CS GO. You can go into it with a pro mindset only making the most logical decisions and still die to random scenarios like a vehicle clipping through a rock to kill you.There's much more to this game than initially meets the eye. It almost feels like a roguelike in that you learn something new almost every playthrough. 400+ hours in and having reached top 50 in solos and duos but I still have a lot to learn.TLDR You can wait for the full release to try and avoid dealing with early access issues but you'll surely encounter them anyway after a major patch. Its the nature of an online game. Just pick it up and enjoy it with your friends while the hype is there you wont regret it!If you've read this entire review good on you! Heres a little secret the game's 3D sound is wonky. Even if you have it through a sound card or a nice headset w/ software just turn it to stereo. It'll work wonders for you. Cheers!,Christian Duke

tutor total,Yes this game is bugged but so is every other early access game I have ever played. Anyone who puts negative comments up around that should really do a brain cell check as I think we are only up to week 22 of the game. Now all the whingers about paid content for the game all need a head check because the paid content is absolutely 100% not required to play any part of the game. It is just to change your chartacters appearance which I personally don't give two hoots about since all I want to do is get chicken dinners. Now gameplay is lots of fun. I mean who doesn't want to parachute into some old soviet island with a few of your mates try to one up each other with what loot you have found and then gho kill some players. Yes the game has some optimisation issues but the big difference is that the developer bluehole is very transparent around what the problems are and once they have been notified about any proiblems there is usually a facebook post letting you know they are working on a fix. Don't let the haters push you away from this game this is a true battle royale which isn't for the faint hearted and you should give it a solid crack. Although it might take you a little while to get your chicken dinner,Lisa Oliver

joki truth,Rocket League! Where do I begin... Rocket League is one of the most inivative games to push the bounderies of sports. Picture yourself SOARING through the air with your only goal too get that good fast hit past the opponent. Rocket league takes soccer and gives it such a unique gameplay... VEHICLES! Be prepared to collide slide tumble and roll around in one of Rocket League's beautiful arenas! Ranging from sunny skies to skill deciding obsticles such as pillars hexagons and plateaus. Graphics 9/10I'd like to keep this short by saying Rocket League runs beautifully on most computers! You can have it optimized for an older 21st century laptop or desktop. Amazing rain effects and tons of customization to take your style to the next level! Gameplay 9/10You start off in rocket league really doing whatever you want from bot matches to hopping right into ranked (not recommended....) Rocket league teaches you patience and causes you to become an overall better gamer! Gameplay modes include 1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4 3v3 Rumble 3v3 Hoops Ranked ques of 1's 2's 3's 3v3 Rocket Labs You also have the full ability to host private lobbies with all sorts of mutator settings! From double speed to half... Quad collision effects to none at all! Change the shape and size of your ball to increase the chaotic aspect! Music 8/10Here's the thing... I don't think I've ever played a game and actually desired to find that perfect balance of volume for the games soundtrack... because well... It's AWESOME! Such a big plus when you load up a game to a beautiful symphony of electronic waves pulling you closer to that QUE button...TL DR Rocket League is an awesome new genre of competitive gameplay that you MUST try at least once.. But don't be alarmed when you fail and fail. This is one of those games in which you could spend 1.000 hours and still be working towards getting that GREAT wall shot.,Bradley Mayer
cari window,a nice game with an original gameplay. Played on single player is quite boring and after 1 day you already want to trash it. His strength is online where competitive battles are really exciting. Sadly the online is also his weakness with too many frustrated people (kids most of the time) who can't accept defeat and start to insult everybody (usually their teammates) like they are the only ones good enough to play this game. More you go high in competitive matches more people like this you'll meet and then it will start to lose most of the fun.In short a good game ruined by bad players. I played for long in my life and rarely seen such a bad community full of angry kids. Not even in Call of Duty. I have more than 330 hours played on Rocket League (I have the Master title and Gold rank in all the competitives games) and I've already seen so many bad players that I could fill a continent. update Also they released a Game of the Year version which includes a few DLCs but there's nothing for who already owns the original game. We have to buy the DLCs separately which costs a little more. It would have been nice if there was a season pass.,Carl Nelson

cari professor,I really enjoy the premise of this game. However hackers have ruined it and made it unplayable...again. Just like they did with legacy. Unfortunatly I would not recommend this game because you will get frustrated after putting in the hard work and hours only to have hackers come along and take your stuff in 5 min. Jump hackers/speed hackers are the main problems I have encountered. I will not be playing rust agiain anytime soon its just a waste of time.,Christine Nichols

cari last,Rocket League is a fun and unique game where you play soccer but with a TWIST... you play with CARS! In Rocket League you can play ranked or unranked which is a ranking system from the highest rank to the lowest rank. You can get items to customize your car and even get different types of cars such as a boost wheels topper(hat) and many different skins and for the items you dont want you can trade with other players to get something better or if you have 5 of the same type of item ( Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Import Body Exotic And of course mystery decal) then you can trade it in for one item of a higher rarity. But beware of scammers! You can also train in the exhibiton or go there just for some fun! You can also buy crates which is a random item which could possibly be a mystery decal. And it's under 20$!!!! I definitely recommend this to anyone that like soccer or cars or BOTH and even if you dont like those 2 things it's still a really good game and i highly recommend you check it out NOW!!!,Dana Best

Since playing on the PS4 and enjoying it so much I felt so bad that I got the game for free that I had to come over and pay full price on Steam for it. Yeah I know the devs get some cheese from Sony for the PS+ promos but still. Rocket League is a beautiful fast and fun pick up and play arcade style sports game. The controls are simple enough that you'll feel like a badass playmaker your first game or so. Oh and the addition of local co op and cross platform play is really nice to see too.,Lisa Hughes

I was able to create a team with full custom uniforms and logos in just an hour after learning the basics. Roster customization is also very easy. This series can very easily be the future madden killer with the right funding. The developers are constantly updating based off player feedback and the series looks promising as a whole. Don't expect a madden level depth of content but rather a fun and infinitly customizable survival experience. And for $20 this game is a massive steal.,Kristi Bailey

joki less,Don't let the negative reviews of potential cheaters and game breakers fool you this is an excellent game. Everything about it is smooth immersive and engaging. There's more content than you can shake a stick at and hundreds and hundreds of hours worth of gameplay to enjoy whether in story mode or playing online. People are upset because the game developers want people to play the game as intended instead of changing it drastically for entertainment purposes. Look at what OpenIV has done they changed the game SO much that now there are hundreds of people bad mouthing the game simply because they can't modify the game to their liking anymore. If OpenIV hadn't come along and tarnished an otherwise flawless product GTA V would still be a gleaming example of what a game should be. Instead it is losing players and the reputation of GTA V is being damaged beyond repair. Here's a big **** You to OpenIV for causing this.Sincerely A True Gamer,Deborah Farrell

I have seen a few hackers but there are really good players in here as well so dont cry when you die. The developers are doing a good job of continuing to bring more content to the game for free. Overall I would say yes I recommend this game to any of my friends. It had its share of trouble in BETA but its not in beta anymore and the full release is faily solid.,Arthur Bailey

joki often,The game itself is pretty fun but they've recently destroyed the modding community for both online and offline play. The new content they add is only accessible online which wouldn't be the worst thing ever but it is locked behind insane prices that would require hours of tedious grinding if you wanted to gather up enough funds. ...or you know you can buy Sharkcards and get a fraction of the content that they put out. For $100 you would get 8 million in game currency which won't even get you very far. You might be able to get a few of the vehicles or the special facilities that they seem to keep locking content behind. To put things into perspective 8 million in game currency isn't even enough to buy the most expensive yacht in the game and the yachts don't really even do that much for you. So Rockstar seems to think that their virtual yacht (you can't even drive it) is worth over 100 dollars.,Cheryl Werner

One of my favourite features is that you can add attachments to weapons unlike H1Z1 KOTK.Also I feel as if PUBG is more realistic which personally gets me on the edge of my seat where as H1Z1 has a m ore Arcade type feeling to it.One of my least favourite things about PUBG is that because its a relatively new release and in early access it doesnt have much to it other than trying to become last man standing. New rank feature on leaderboards and if you do end up becoming the last man standing the rewards are pretty pathetic (couple of hundred coins). Other than that its a great game. Dont be worrying about what I said negatively as this can be fix in further updates and as the game progresses.,Amanda Allison

cari moment,"Wow. Does this game ever have a nice single player I gotta say other than the tediousness lack of check points sometimes it's very very good! However the thing that I bought this game for! Online! The iest servers in the ing universe D! Boy do I ever love trying to play with my friends! To bad it takes 10 minutes to do so! Please don't give me ""You probably have internet or a crappy computer"" because I have very good internet and a very good pc. If this isn't good enough it's not my above average hardware that I use to play games with daily it's rockstar... They managed to optimize the game super well I get very good frames but to bad it takes 5 minutes at the least to start playing the game I understand it has a huge world but if I use an example say skyrim (a game that came out 2011) has a giant world and Gta came out 2 years later with a smaller world by the looks of it to me skyrim takes about 2 minutes to load in for me...Now here is my biggest issue. Every ing heist Lamar missions and anything else that forces 4 people. I know that rockstar wants you to play with your friends but if one of them time out boom you just wasted another 5 30 minutes depending on how far you are and if you're like me half the time you don't have 4 friends to play with so it's a random who is either nice and will understand your mistakes and his mistakes or you get mr. who judges you for dying once then goes ahead and runs into the battle field with the ing OP enemies and gets killed in 2 seconds because it's on hard and you actually want to play the game for the good parts of it so you try to make money. But he decides to leave and you're stuck here having to do the tedious heist setup or what ever again... all to make a 1/5 of a 100 thousand dollars which is about a 1/10 away from a good car! 1 good car! THE THING YOU PLAY GRAND THEFT AUTO FOR! FUN IN VEHICLES! Hacking the game is the best way to go about this btw you only get banned for 2 weeks and keep all your stuff for some mentally challenged reason... Also the 5 10 million dollar things!? Buy a couple $100 shark cards and you can afford them oh btw they're just for looks you can get something that functions the same for a quarter of the price ).This one hit me personally. All the tediously hard missions I've never understood why game devs do this... I know half of these are completely optional but it's still money that you really want and need if you play legit like me... Like flight school... jesus christ I've never played something so hard in my life it's boring hard annoying and it over all made me angry and that's why I'm writing this poorly done review... because the game is me off. Trust me if you got some good friends there is fun to be made out of the grinding if you have some time just hack the game and you'll also have a ton of fun if you have money buy shark cards on top of the $60 game you can spend an extra $100 to have even more fun than the base game! Oh and by the way a shirt costs $14000. EDIT Started playing again with friends super fun but still the same bull shi applies but hackers seem to be a bigger problem I see at least 1 a day... and they're usually ready to ruin your experience for some reason...",Martin Bryant

cari fine,The single player campaign was pretty good. I prefer creating my own character in these kind of games and didn't really care for the three main character thing. I don't blame them for trying though. There was a lot of love (and hard work) put into this game and it shows.Multiplayer is pointless. Unless you grind through missions for months you won't be able to buy 1/4 of the cool stuff available (cars planes property etc). I still mess around online with friends but it would be great if you could earn money without buying shark cards or paying a hacker.,Karen Stanley

joki same,I love this game and I wanted to grind it out quite hard after waiting more than two weeks for the release however I came to a huge dissapointment.After buying it straight when it came out I couldn't run the game at all and I still can't after some time of waiting for the optimisation patch or something like that. After going through pretty much every post on the forum and tutorials on youtube how to max out the performance of this unoptimised I give up. The minimum system requirements are a total lie and only the best rigs can run it fine... It's a shame but I will still wait for the patch because I really enjoy watching the game and I would be even more pleased if I could actually play it. For 27 I expected much better. As I said there is nothing wrong with the game itself it's just the performance and optimisation section which made me not recommend this game at the current time. After some months I will revisit this game and do another review of this to see if anything changes.UPDATE After the optimisation update and buying new RAM I have little to no problem of running the game.,Savannah West

cari standard,Rockstar has pulled the wool over our eyes. We were expecting a moding experiance that would add years to this game. However 1 month after millions of players purchased this game and no longer had any chance of gaining a refund for there money they decided to alter their EULA. Now the End User Licences Agreement forbids a user from altering the game in any capicity. Meaning if you Mod this game you will be banned from not only the multiplayer servers but from your own private singleplayer games aswell.I can not reccommend this game I was had.,Kevin Ortega

tutor price,"This game is fun and frustrating at the same time. The concept is great but the execution so far has been sub par. I've played for 200+ hours and have not really had the crashing issues many have experienced. My biggest complaints are my FPS has dropped 10 15 FPS on average the lack of region control and hackers. I could live with the FPS drop if I could at least play with someone who speaks my language. It seems likely that they might have also been banned a time or two with names like ""56894565"". The whole point of servers in dedicated regions is to be able to communicate with your squad mates. I hope in time some of these issues will be addressed. My system has plenty of horsepower so that isn't an issue.",John Dean

cari budget,"I'd just like to start off by saying the game is great. The amount of hours I have put into it is only rivaled by the likes of CSGO. The gameplay is fast and action packed. If you are able to get some friends to buy this game with you. Do it.Now comes my problem. I got home today excited to jump back into the action only to be greeted by ""You have been permanently banned in PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS by the game's developer"" I didn't quite know how to react so I looked to see if it was a possible mistake or maybe some negligence on my behalf. So I went through all my game files and other programs on my computer. After coming up empty I decided to look at my name and my profile to see if I had any offensive or derogatory content that might offend some people. Besides the vulgar comments left by my friends I could not find anything that could contribute to a permaban. So I submitted a ticket and decided to write this review. I will be more than happy to change the review to positive if this problem can be ironed out. I am even willing to change the review and remain positive as long as Bluehole and/or PlayerUnkown can give me a valid explanation for the permabanning with evidence. Until this however I am going to leave this review up. I wholeheartedly want this game to succeed over competitors like fortnite. But if this is how longtime players players who have actively supported the game since its alpha stages are being treated. Then I cannot find it within me to give this game a positive review.",Jesse Schultz

cari more,As much as I love GTA V and Rockstar Games Take Two really screwed this one up. I understand that if the mods are voilating any online rules or legal stuff you should be able to take those ones down but SINGLE PLAYER MODS AS WELL? Single player mods are doing absolutely no harm whatsoever to your game I think that these modders are making GTA V a much better game because the truth is I don't really enjoy story mode so much so single player is just boring without mods. The world you created in Los Santos is so detailed and so well made that I think it should be explored more but without mods it just gets really damn boring. I'm sorry but that's the truth.

This should notbe a fear that I have if I do not mod/hack the game. I read other reviews and notice that they are exactly in my place right now 100ish level and a couple million dollars in the game. Why is it that I have the fear of gettingbanned for no reason while all the other hackers can easily roam freely without a carein the world? I think that there should be special servers for modding withoutupsetting those who want to play the game legit. Overall Online mode is fun butthere is a fear of getting banned for playing the game the way the creatorswant you to.

cari must,"By far the worst investment I've ever made in a game in the past 10 years.So many bad things about this game I don't know where to begin.First of all the keyboard and mouse control are terrible and have all these annoying little things... like ""esc"" button won't take u to the previous menu and more things that u would think are like a basic thing in every game yet it's different in this one.Also graphics look terrible... for sure u can see the game was originally made for the console and the resolution looks like 720p even on a 1080p resolution or even 4k.Another annoying this which was the real deal breaker for me game saves only before and after missions!It doesn't save things instantly like a regular onlineg ame. So here's what happend to me I sat down going all out upgrading my equipment. Was so happy with all my new crafter stuff I went on an online quest (which for some reason didn't saved anything before I started it).... I landed... started collecting lots of cool stuff (again I was happy)...... and then all of a sudden a disconnection!Came back and guess what? NOTHING was saved. All my items all the things I've collected were nowhere to be found.THIS GAME IS BAD and might be worth 5$ TOPS!! (And I'm being genrous).",Scott Torres

The game in my expiriance has been very situational mabey you build your base hidden behind some rocks and then all of a sudden somebody with loads of gear builds on the other side of the rock formation without seeing your base and then when he sees it he decides it would be a good idea to burn down your poor little shack and take your 1 singular hatchet that you spent an hour trying to get because you kept on getting killed I will now recount one of my expiriances in this game me you know I think i'll build behind this pile of rocks in order to keep my base hiddennon descript guy with no clothes you know I think i'll build my house in the woods near that rock formationtwo annoying 14 year olds lets build our base right in between the woods and that rock formation!guy with a crossbow hey I see like 4 people over there building let me go murder them!me oh sh*t that guy with a crossbows running right at me!two annoying 14 year olds hey see that guy lets go scream curses and sh*t at him!non descript guy with no clothes god f*cking dammit more people here to kill meme SH*T SH*T SH*T!

joki rather,Game 5/5 Playing experience 2/5While the game itself is excellent in its simplicity (a bunch of people scavenging for weapons and going at it with the last one(s) remaining the winner) it would be even better if it actually worked relatively well. Small bugs that make you run while blinking back a couple of paces now and again are annoying but now not even that incomplete gaming experience is availabe as servers are offline.In short the game itself is excellent (at least during the early access phase it was). It does not run smoothly though and we probably have millions of patches (as usual) to look forward to... Yay...Anyone interested in buying this game would probably do well to wait a few months as the game is nearly unplayable at times at the moment. When it IS playable however it is one of the most exciting and addictive games out there. Regardless of whether you like 1st person shooters or not.I recommend this game to everyone... ...when it's finally ready in a few months.,Christopher Duran

joki health,"This game is the epitome of Early Access games. Pay 30 dollars get crap servers crap balancing and even crap rendering. It's such a crap bargain! It's amazing that it's sold as well as it has and has the hype it does. It's the kind of game that just screams ""I'll never be a final release!"" They'll try polishing it up over about 2 years but the final release will never come if it does it will still be lackluster compared to any real developer created FPS game. That being said if it was around 15 dollars it would be worth the purchase just to see what facing 100 players crapping around one map feels like. It was hard the first 10 hours getting used to it kind of fun for about 20 hours and then when you realize how horribly balanced it is you just start to spend more time playing other games because this one pisses you off. I will say that the only fun part is the first few times you get to the last 10 or so people because you get that adrenaline rush from being so close to the top and the tension is real. Overall I'd rate it 6/10. It has a lot of room for improvement and hell if they actually finished the game to the extent 2017 games SHOULD be made then it will be something to look twice at. Until then Buyer Beware!",Felicia Webster

tutor once,"I bought this game on PC hyped to get to finally play the years of work on Xbox 360 and Xbox One I put in for my character on PC and they decided to claim my 25 million of real money I spent months working for as ""modded money"". Then after I recieved unwanted modded money after that recent procceded to reset my character that I spent 4 years building up since GTA Online first launched and ban me for a month. I would not reccomend buying this game for GTA Online or Singleplayer GTA V is dying and stuff like this that happened to me is just making more people leave the game and the singleplayer is not worth it they wanted to focus so much on GTA Online that they cancelled all the future DLCs for Singleplayer. I loved this game before all of this happened that I did not deserve and would not reccomend playing it unless you got it for free.",Brittany Alvarez

Great to play to with friends and has plenty of options if you want to play with AI or even to practice getting used to the controls. I would definitely recommended playing with a controller as it is the only way to perform flying hits.Possiblly the best 14 I've paid for a game.

tutor value,Apart from the current lack of content that I'll forgive due to early access tho Early Access is starting to look like almost as bad an idea as Kickstarter for games lately only here you get to see what you've done immediately this game has one problem I cannot forgive ignore or even remotely enjoy the game due to.People are bloody awful.I died in less than a minute the first dozen or so servers I tried then for the first three hours after that some dude would always kill me the minute I got food a tool and started on my home. Now I might be able to deal with the pain that is other people if they were just an added challenge but they aren't. People are voices. PEople are persistant. People are evil.And this game has produced some weird kind of evil at that. Day Z is downright friendly in comparison and CoD voice chat a cheerful conversation in the quad. That said that could (probably is) the very reason many people like this game so perhaps I might've recommended it instead but that would leave an even worse taste in my mouth than playing it.,Christopher Lawrence

It's just one big stupid ripoff for a poor chance at a terrible selection of cosmetic t. Concept was boring in Arma 3 and really though the team ques really helped it's still boring as hell.

So be prepared for a repetetive simple SP game that takes place in a great looking world. and for those who say hey just play with your freinds well some dont like waiting around all day for when a couple people on your freinds list are online to go fight ai. It is like a IP LAN only game then which is not always the most exciting thing to wait around to play.If they were able to get rid of most of the hackers i would give it a thumbs up. Either that or add a billion things to SP to make it interesting one or the other. As it is now though this game has no replay value,Monique Miller

tutor serve,I originally couldn't play due to bugs and crashing and started with a negative review that I said I would update once it would play consistently enough. At first it was the refresh rate setting in game causing constant crashes. Since I have a 120 hz monitor i set it to that in game but it kept crashing. When I tried leaving it at 60hz or 99 hz the inital crashing stopped. Then i started getting intermittent ERR_GFX_D3D_INIT crashes to desktop sometimes combined with nvlddmkm error telling me to reboot or reinstall the game every 10 minutes to 2 hours. Also I was seeing a lot of screen tearing with or without v sync no difference. After looking around for troubleshooting advice I found a solution that worked for me here https //www.youtube.com/watch?v TjEQmZrRmtEIt turns out that some cards' max boost clocks don't match the standard boost value being reported.

The timer reaches ten seconds then boom someone leaves! The option to start match when there is only one survivior should have been added! Plus the is the fact this game eats RAM. It was running at 4.5GB when I ran it for an hour! I cannot recommend this game til the Devs fix some of the issues with it!!,Kevin Molina

cari model,Hello Take Two I know that rockstar doesnt want modding to be banned because at the start they where supporting it. But because there is money involved thing change radicaly. When banning modding you take away the fun you can have with non vanilla software. By doing this you are forcing your buyers (players) to play what you have created. If you are paying money for something you should have the right to alter it in a little way. Its the same with cars you buy a car and may change the color of it as many times as you want or even upgrade it without buying a new one. I tink you should revise your choice of banning modding and making it undone.TheDutchGoat,Alexandra Moore

tutor force,Overally the game is very good. Graphics are nice and gameplay is interesting. Variety of survivors killers perks offerings items and add ons gives you other tactics and changes the whole gameplay. Thanks to that Dead by Daylight is still fun even after playing for 100+ hours. The one thing that might be irritating is people some killers just camp near a hooked survivor making it impossible to save him. I know that's a part of the game but it can sometimes stop you from making a daily ritual especially when your playing as a character you don't main.,Jessica Lyons

Aber Hype ist nicht gleich gutes Spiel z.B. CoD. Scheiß game riesen Hype um jeden Ableger. Und jetzt will Bule Hole noch mehr neue Features einbauen...

cari this,Rust...what can i say about a fun enjoyable game like rust.let's see...oh COMPLETLY AWSOMEyou spawn with a rock 2 bandages and a torch your only goal is to survive.i only got the game because my friend said it was fun i realy didnt enjoy but thats because i didnt understand itthis game is so amazing when my friend finaly got on our big trouble was trying to find eachother but we finaly did we did so many amazing things we decided to hide in the mountain's since its more peacefule there untill we could get a gun we noticed that there are these rad zones filled with radiation if your rads go over 500 your dead but the rad areas are full of research kits if you cant craft something you can use these research kits so when you die you can craft it again but me and my friend (jeseipi) decided to wait untill were more radiation resistant come to find out we find this guy's house full of epic loot he had a 9mm pistol along with 9mm ammo i took that when i saw it and found these things called rad pills that take off radiation so after i gathered those i thought we should set camp for the night it began as two little shaks and a campfire outside the a little later after gathering enough materials we had a little tiny fort then we set up this thing called a foundatio wich was wood block used for walls or something so after a little bit more we had this room that noone could raid unless they had c4's (very rare in the game) then i decided to finaly use the rad pill's and go get some epic loot i heard about in the rad zones i brought my gun with me because there are radiated animals and are deadly so after picking off the animals i entered the zone and found lots of things like research kits and rad armor while jeseipi was gathering resources i thought while he gather's resources ill just help us advance in technology and we got to the point where jeseipi had made us this nice sized fort and i had gotten us from 1 pistol to m4's and silencer's so we decided to go to the rad zone together (we had gathered alot more rad pills) and we would work on getting research kits so we can learn how to craft things we dont know how to craft (when you start you can craft the basic stuff under the crafting list you use this research kit to add to the list so you can craft it) and then we had to go for the day so when i got back on i found that a noob had taken his time to break one of my walls and steal all of my things this included m4 two 9mm pistol's and three p250's all my good armor and bunches of important mateial's. so that leaves with me having to recraft everything i did eventualy gt everything (jeseipi was offline and i decided to check on our base while he was away and when you disconnect your character's body will lay there till you log on again leaving you 100% vulnerable unless ur behind a metal door) and the rest of the story will continue tommorow 5/11/2014 at 5 00pm.i highly recommend this game it is extremly fun everyone needs to know this game it is so realistic as well i love the ambience as well there are even Some servers where people have built large villages me and jeseipi went on an empty server so we wouldnt get raided right away.,Melissa Davis
cari mention,It is better then DayZ could be pretty special with a few updates. After playing a good amount of hours now with friends and then taking a very long break I am amending this review slightly. I will say that the game was a blast for awhile but due to the limitations of what has been provided by the developers thus far the fun runs out pretty fast for my group of friends and I. I am keeping the game installed and updated awaiting the big changes when they release the new version. The game is still very promising and I would still recommend it to anyone who enjoys survival first person games.,James Bridges

They need to review the game for what it actually is not because of what could be considered a ""bad buisness practice"" (most $60 dont even go on sale anyways so dont blame rockstar for taking the same road and trying to throw in extra in game money). The game itself is great. i dont want to go into an in depth review but i would suggest watching the angry joe review or a credible reviewer give their take not some random plebs who dont even talk about how the game actually playes.",Amanda White

joki get,I got banned from Rust 351 days ago! I was playing for the first time on my new computer because I was excited so I joined an offical server. I was just playing around for a little bit becuase I had no idea what to do. So then I was wondering and found a pile of keys on the ground so I picked them all up and tried every key locked base I could find. Then I found the one with the right key! So I opend it and found 3 Sleepers and I killed them all and took there stuff. Then I made my base and logged off. Wasent a good base but good for the night. So I went to bed IRL. Woke up excited to play Rust. Boom banned and could not join any server at all. So i spent 40$ for get banned after 20 hours! Why would I cheat. Then I put in many reports from Email. Non of them even got opend I got no responce nothing!!! So I decided to finally put it somewhere that they may actually look at it. If they were duped keys why would I get banned for it. Why not the dupper!! But I really enjoyed the game until I got banned!,Melissa May

tutor value,((Updated))They're working on bringing back OpenIV stop giving good games a bad rep (I've even seen this on Kerbal Space Program). Leaving a bunch of bad reviews wont do all. Especially when you do it on games that have nothing to do with GTA 5. Grow up. The singleplayer is good multiplayer is a bit grindy but with a couple heists you can get most of the stuff unlocked (content wise like CEO/Biker stuff). Not going to give everyone a bad name but there are alot of people leaving bad reviews just because they can't use OpenIV to cheat in multiplayer anymore. Those that are doing it because of singleplayer mods I get it. But at least keep your ing and moaning to the game in question. Spreading it to games that Take Two has even barely breathed on (KSP for example) is hurting nobody but those developers. TL DR ignore the negative reviews about OpenIV but dont buy it unless it's 50% off or better.,Edward Mcgee

cari modern,"One of the best open world/action/online games. Really loved it can't wait for more uptades!EDIT OK I think that I can properly judge the online part of the game as I have over 650 hours. Every dlc is EXACTLY the same. The olny difference is that with every dlc you have to pay more real life money to be able to get the full experience. I mean ok I understand that they somehow must make money bit I believe that if those dlc were not free both the community and the items would be better. With every dlc they add new weapons (personally i dont know anyone who uses more than 2 rifles the heavy sniper the RPG and the AP pistol) new vehicles (and because it is GTA all vehicles are similar) with customization that costs an extraordinary amount and the same jobs re made with another name and different vehicles. Ok R* you want money but I do not want to play a repetitive game hours of grinding just to buy a car and almost impossible to play the game alone.At this point I actually do not know how to rate the game so I will leave the ""thumbs up"" but I am not sure if this game is worth the amount you will pay.2015 10/102017 6/10",Katherine Abbott

cari term,,Nancy Davis
cari action,Their is many things wrong about this game. One building is if you want to destroy a wall its essintially impossible and if you misplace an object oh well that object is gone. If you lost your keys from someone and you are trapped in your house with no resources welp you just have to break a wall to get out. Also the community is . I was about done with this game so i decided how about i give my house to someone if they did not kill me but no they just would rather kill someone who has nothing than go to a house with guns turrents chests full of loot and food. Also if you want to make a team that probably wont happen because 99% of the people their would kill you immediatly even if you have no loot at all. Its more of a deathmatch than a survival game. Also this game has been out for five ing years and its still alpha wtf. Oh and also if you dont want to play a deathmatch game and play a singleplayer rust well basically thats since the only enemys are bears and wolves which dont really harm you if you have a sleeping bag nearby. This game would be so good if people dont try to instantly kill you everytime you see them. When I play a survival game I want a game were people try to make friends and work together not just player on their computer killing eachother for absolutly no reason. Overall the game is great without the people and the building part but since the game is basically a multiplayer game its because of the community.,Lisa Keller

joki example,I have this game both here on PC and on PS4. Combined I have over 250 hours playing.This review won't be that long as there are only a few things I think are really pertinent to you purchasing/not purchasing this game.1) It's multiplayer. Playing with friends is more fun. If you like playing single player games don't get this. There are more fun multiplayer games to go at solo anyway.2) This game is fun. It's soccer with rocket boosted cars. I mean come on that's just fun.3) It's easy to jump in and play. If your gaming time is a little more limited and you want something you can play for 30 minutes this is a great game for that.4) If you tilt easily in multiplayer games then either don't buy this game or realize that you'll straight up need to stop playing for a bit when you start to get mad. I get mad sometimes when I go on a losing streak. When that happens stop for the day.,Daniel Smith

cari position,While the idea behind Rust is very good and very nice and worth the $20 the game itself comes nowhere close to that. Admittedly I just started playing a month ago or so but still. Maybe it was good back then but I can tell you it is not good now. Any of the servers that you are gonna get on you know as a starter (so the noob ones or beginner only ones) are all filled with dummies like you gettiing absolutely nothing done. The blind are just leading the blind to nowhere good. The best part about these servers are when you pick a fight against a dude with a rock while you have a spear. 10/10 gameplay. I know that there are many videos and documents that tell you how to play but not to seem like I'm a TL DR sort of guy it ruins the fun to study something just so that you can play it. If you want to just hop right in and have so much fun with the people in the newest server well then this game is not for you. While I am sure that many people will love this game if you want to jump right into a game don't want to be doing nothing the first hour or two want to not get pummeled by people most obviously better than you want to not get left behind by bozos that won't help you for the same reason you won't study the gameplay mechanics to the core so you can get anything or just want your computer to not take 10 years or so to get into one single server then this game just isn't for you. It's not for me and that's why it gets a bad review. (,Lauren Robinson

cari action,"I do not recommend this game to potential buyers. It has a very high skill cap for new players to learn the game to the point of many people not wanting to try it again because they get absolutely demolished by people abusing exploits to lower their ranks and somehow not getting banned for it.... Meaning people playing killer with 2200+ hr gameplay are getting put in the same match with 0 30 hour survivors. This is terrible design. It's also terrible that survivors are getting nerfed more and more. Less pallets bloodlust slower vault speeds games being extended longer by several minutes because of perk combinations like Ruin and BBQ Chili.... BBQ Chili even on Billy is the most anti fun game you can play. This game has gone from jump scare Michael games to annoying grind fests where you're held hostage in a round with a killer... e.g. a Doctor that you have to attempt to sneak around which is nearly impossible and also impossible to get away from Doctors or do any actions once they've chased you for a while. Ultimately the devs are making bad decisions by killing off interest for most of the player base the survivors. They're taking away bright/dark moonlight nerfing flashlights again reducing pallets more..... it's just way too much. The mechanic of simply ""running away"" is boring. Little strategy involved there. With devs talking about taking away moonlight already having nerfed mist to it not being worth playing etc... it sounds like they're trying to address the issue of people hacking items on their accounts in a less than productive way. I think there's a huge problem now that you have to rely more and more on terrible teammates to unhook you. This isn't scary it's annoying. Many of these changes just lead to frustrating game play. I'd say a reason many people still play is to unlock everything but even then it's not really great because devs are making games longer without actually giving us much more points.On the weekend that Freddy was released I got 3 5k tops most games. Normally with my full build I would get maybe 12 20k+. Doesn't matter if it's bonus points weekend if you still end up getting average points because you don't properly play test a killer and balance it.... you guys should seriously read the review bombs that happened around Halloween when Freddy came out. It was all deserved because little testing clearly went in to Freddy and it was nearly impossible to get away from him or do anything. Rare skillchecks to be found item add ons that were supposed to give you more skillchecks actually REDUCED your chance sabotage didn't cause you to wake up from his dream perma deerstalker on you etc.... just led to a very anti fun weekend. I should say it can be fun... especially if you group up with friends on voice chat but if new killers continue to end up being as unbalanced as Freddy and if devs continue to ruin their own game by keeping survivors hostage in garbage killer rounds then I cannot recommend this game anymore. Again the skill cap is already really high and these killer perks are punishing new players even more than previously... if you get demolished every time you play you might not want to play again. This has been the case for a number of my friends.****** TIPS FOR DEVS TO IMPROVE * Stop nerfing survivors. Removing items completely from the game (as well as pallets) is not a fix for balancing gameplay. It just makes the game more two dimensional and bland.* Survivors absolutely need ways to counter BBQ Chili more. Hiding in lockers should counter BBQ Chili. If a killer is BAD he should not be babysat by saying ""here are the survivors""... it takes away skill from the game.* Doctor is way too strong still. There should be a much longer window between screams when in stage 3 it's already way too easy for a doctor to hunt someone down even after they escape. If you ESCAPE from a killer by juking you should be able to get away for good. You shouldn't be punished for it. This is very bad design. You should not have to rely on selfish randoms to save you.* Consider adding a tutorial video or training mode for killers / survivors. The tips in the pre loading screen is a good start though",Ricardo Lozano

cari Mrs,"My grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate you have to stop immediately."". Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. Now I'm 24 and never touched a cigarette. I must say I feel a slight sense of regret for never having done it because the cheaters in this game gave me cancer anyway.",Mrs. Madison Mccullough

joki participant,Though my early access review was positive I'm gonna be honest the game has changed alot some for the better some for the worst. 1. Where has the weather gone? it was fun when it might be raining or foggy and make the game more challeneging yeha it would you off to get sniped in the fog but it would also be funny and the dicersity was great. 2. Hackers...... seraiously do something about them please!......maybe impose region locks....3. The emotes and stuff just why te pose no purpose. BE PUBG NOT FORTNITE. 4. You' really went and introduced keys and creatws didn't you. This isn't no CSGO bull this is PUBG you added the microtransactions for nothing! Weapon skins really? Making a random create dropper instead of the free one for people is a move man.Bottom Line i still like pubg but its loseing its identity its become a csgo foortnite instead of focusing on making its own chracter. People aready baught the game now you're gonna charge us to unlock creates? Mate off. Don't become greedy s like EA when you have a good game going.

joki especially,"1/13/2050How did the world turn out the way it is now. Why the youth are being sent down the wrong path. Everytime I wonder this to myself I only hear one reply. It resounds in the back of my mind a distant fear. My only fear. It comes like a whisper. One word. ""Fortnite"". The very thought of the word sends a shiver down my spine. I laugh and shake the notion out of my mind I reminisce on the good ol' days of Minecraft... back when society had taste. Now society is ridden by a plague. ""Fornite "" the voice screams. ""FORTNITE!"" it yells! Make it stop. Please make it stop. Help me. They are coming and they won't stop. I can't give my son any money in the fear that he ends up like those other kids. They'd take the money and buy their foolish skins for themselves or worse influence my boy into that cursed game... If only I could educate them. Show them the truth. They think the poison that they willingly inject through their eyes is so amazing. No game needs developers that active. It's just bad news. There needs to be space between the developers and the users. And bugs? Those add character to the game. Without bugs in a game you just get a lifeless white hallway set in some dystopian future. There needs to be something that pulls you back to reality so that we can still grasp our humanity. Just thinking about the ideal state of a game reminds me of an old friend. Todd. A man of legend that quickly fell from grace because society just wasn't ready for his genius... That's a story for another time though. I must go now. They say the regime knows all. They'll know about this quickly and they're going to come for me. I have to leave with my son so that he may not end up like them.GoodbyeOh yeah this game makes me want to tonguepunch my son's fartbox",Anna Hall
tutor major,Brutal but seems to be a better choice over H1Z1 or ARK considering the price and decent optimisation. The game doesn't succumb to survival cleches like zombies but instead focuses on the conflicts and peace between the players by implementing several mechanics for attacking and defending bases but also sharing houses and territory with other players.Edit Try modded if you're solo.

And whoever thought a desert map would be a good idea should quit game design forever. Fortnite does everything better than this game. Where is the loot? It's too hard to find anything useful at all. I can't believe I was excited when they implemented mantling. Just shows how blind the devs are to what is actually needed. MAKE THE DAMN GAME FUN!

cari body,"First I owned the PS3 version then bought the PC version lured in by some gameplays on youtube.I already finished story mode in the PS3 version (finished as in I got bored by the bland characters without any agency other than ""gotta make that paper brah"" and stopped playing the game because the world was boring and the cops were killing any and all fun to be had) so I basically bought this for online mode.The good things first OptimizationThe game runs great. The Framerate seldom dips. GraphicsIt looks pretty good.Now about the negative aspects. GTA online is a boring grind. I told myself I'd not care about money and levels but it turns out you have to and you have to grind the same few jobs over and over and over to get money and rank points to level up because EVERYTHING is hidden behind a pay and rank wall so tall Trump would tell Rockstar to take it down a notch. The payouts are really poor so it takes you forever to save up money for something you'd like but can't buy because your level isn't high enough. Now I wouldn't mind this if the races were fun but all I get is the same boring supercar race (looking at you congestion charge) over and over then maybe some ""muscle up"" perhaps one or another offroad race but they're all equally dull.Where the hell are the oddball races? Taking rusty tractors down Mt. Chiliad? Racing golf carts on a runway which planes are taking off and landing on? Cycling on the freeway in the opposing lane with traffic on? Helicopter races through the wind mill farm? Faggios through a cow farm? ANYTHING ELSE THAN ANOTHER ""DRIVE THIS EXOTIC SUPERTURD ON THE SAME COURSE YOU'VE DRIVEN ON COUNTLESS TIMES JUST TO GET THAT MEASLY PAYOUT?""Oh"" you'll say ""Just make these races yourself and then host them"".Yeah I'll make them and then grow a nice beard waiting for even one soul to join.

cari carry,If you played The Culling before the cancer patch you will probably like this game. It's basically the same besides a lot more people and the combat is largely focussed around guns. So it will be pretty hard for the developers to make the combat system slower **cough**culling**. A large amount of the complaints for this game are focused around micro transactions. Something to note is that all of the items you can buy on the steam market are cosmetics that in no way alter your gameplay. On top of that if you are like me couldn't care less about running around in a yellow suit. You can just sell everything on the steam market. I've made like 7 dollars by selling garbage to kids with their moms credit card but if you get really lucky some items are worth hundreds. So there is that on top of the game being super fun(mainly with friends). Only con I can think of is it seems to mainly drive off your cpu. So if you have a great gpu and a ehh cpu like me you are probably going to be playing on low medium.,Megan Rodriguez

joki before,PUBG has some of the best shooting mechanics in any game. The weapons all feel very different from each other with the esceptions of a few pistols the recoil is very easy to control and every kill you get feels very satisfying. Most of the bugs have been ironed out in the recent patches and the servers feel much better with the recent update they got. The only parts that are noticibly buggy are landing around many buildings/trees or trying to pick items up using the pickup key and not the inventory. In conclusion PUBG is fun the bugs are not as bad as people make it out to be and its fun to shoot things,Cynthia Lee

Their support team told me I had a processor but it never reached more than 70% preformance when the game crashed because 'the processor reached max prefromance and could not handle it.' And my CPU was within the minimum spec list so clearly that's not why the game crashes. It's because PUBG have a completely support team and development team who keep on updating the game only to create more problems than they fix.,Joshua Murray

joki model,While this game is a really fun multiplayer game especially when playing alongside friends the game is too unstable for me to enjoy properly. A current issue I'm experiencing is reoccuring rubberbanding at the start of every match no matter the server or game ranked official or private match. A bit of digging turns up a lot of other people having various rubberbanding and lag issues as well.If you're able to enjoy the game without these issues it is a fun and challenging experience that rewards both individual skill as well as co ordinated teamwork. The physics are a bit cartoony but that seems to be somewhat of an artistic decision.When I'm able to play it it's a lot of fun. However the issues I'm having with the game is really frustrating and often disrupts what is otherwise a fun gaming session. A pity really. I do hope they patch the game up right quick.,Mrs. Janet Jackson
joki enough,I must have downloaded and deletd this game at least a few times already and it takes about two days to get it but it was worth it but I still rate it as the best GTA so far aside from the fact it lacks character creation training of the character to learn different moves and some off the classic arcade games and pool. It has some very creative missions and side missions with easily the best graphics and game dynamics I have seen working to date it does lack the simplicity of GTA one and two and at street level without the missions or side missions it can become tiresome the online play is also very satisfying I recommend buying it if you have the right system spec as long as Im not bugging about what it hasn't got I'd like to see it remade again in a more individualy customisable manor with missions made slightly differently more true to the original game based in a different decade lets hope theres plenty of remixes on the cards of the same game slightly different than it is and it would be hugely entertaining.,Sarah Carlson

Where do they get off pretending they ever cared about hackers in Online???Ok game bad unregulated and unbalanced online mode and modding is now essentially illegal. God help anyone who got this game on PC just so they could mod it.,Amy Stuart
tutor however,"Games like these are games that make me wish steam had a ""so so"" setting for reviews. As someone that's played every platform of PUBG I really love this game. There's nothing like it honestly. You can add attachments to weapons during the round which I've wanted in a game like this for what felt like forever and it has a certain degree of challenge and a learning curve that comes with it. Trying to find what attachments are the best with what guns. Also the maps are all pretty big and take a while to explore. While this game is really fun and is worth 30 dollars it is still pretty buggy for a full release and still isn't optimized like it should be. I understand that the maps are all huge and take a lot to handle them with the graphics but it seems like time after time especially on the new Sanhok map random fps drops happen that cost me a kill or the entire round of the game itself. Like a totally perfect loadout and about to get an awesome headshot but then the game freezes and the guy i shot at just lasers me. It really is a shame that this happens frequently but it seems like the devs are working hard to fix that. Anyways that was my 2 cents on PUBG I don't hate it nor do I want it 24/7 but it is a solid BR option.",Kelly Cole

,I am tired of playing your new map. Can we finally have option to pick which map we want to play?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?,
,Best Game ever,
,Servers are always on maintenance. What a bunch of amateur not able to built a server redundancy function with maintenance rollover that do not cause interuption. I wish I never purshase that game....,
,This game is good actually but there are some mistakes like vector and tommy gun is not very good and AKM is quite badmeanwhile scar and m4 is the best weapon kar86 should not one hit headshot helmet lvl 3 coz too opand Servers like SEA have no FPP yet at least some duo or squad not very good but the gameplay is good,
,Product received for free. At first I was confused by the weird concept of a game based around cars playing football and didn't really enjoy it but after a while i got the hang of it and the game felt really smooth and nice. At the start of the game i sadly didn't get a tutorial so i had to figure it out myself wich in a way was extreamly fun ! D I can only recomment this game it's got an amasing feel to it has great music and is generally amasing !,
,very fun and addicting game. considering its only alpha i have high hopes for this game. keep up the good work,
,Its in Sick!,
,Great game just need the game to be balanced that would be fun or add 2 killers instead of 1 that would be good to team up.or if somebody complain about the two killers we can make it hard for the survivors to unlock things and make it longer for them to open the doors or do an extra mission to open the biggest doors or something like that.That would be much more fun if the game is more balanced or they add another killer,
,fun fun fun trevor is the sht,
,is so ing cool,
,Utterly garbage yet addictive game.,
,Best Game,
,Runs smooth on 1920x1200 res with a HD7950 3gb mostly maxed out at 50 60fps with the new AMD Catalyst Version 15.4 Beta drivers.No problem also with installing on SSD's. So so far so good. so can recommend it for now.Update runs smooth most of the time sometimes the fps sticks on 30 when i join the game which can be solved by going in graphic settings and back ingame. Dunno if thats a bug ingame or from my gpu though. They could work a bit more on the lag in tennis though )Buy if u just play the singleplayer.Dont buy if u like to play online.,
,yes,
,Best type of open world survival game action u will get on a game.,
,A very fun and realistic game.Offline mode is very fun and online mode is a lot of fun.,
,disappointing,
,"Had this game since 2016 sucked at this game and this was the time when I had a bad PC. Over these 2 years I have developed my skills to become a Gold III. Not much compared to a Champ I or II but I felt that I accomplished a lot in this game. Got a high tier in the Rocket Pass to get all the way up to Tier 70. This game is very unique and fun and I had a lot of fun playing this game everyday with my friends. That is why I nominate this game for ""Better With Friends"". Thx Psyonix &lt 3",
,mun ma ma,
,Honestly this game is a roller coaster of emotions there's vanilla servers which have 0 mods added nothing to help you in gather things faster which is nice but I don't recommend being solo on them or if you do start out as solo then get a friend or friends then there's modded servers these servers can vary you have servers where you can gather resources 2 10 times most servers above 3x are there to help you around the game then you have aim training and battlefield servers the servers mainly to help you control spray paterns these servers are great if you want to get better in the game.I recommend this game to people who don't get frustrated easily and for people that are okay with losing progress that you've put hours into this game is about gaining and losing there's s all over but sometimes you meet nice people which you begin a great experience with. If you buy this game good luck in the buttnaked world,
,i love trhis game its a great community along with excelent ervers.pros lots of gameplay value great community competitve many rank systems and daily challengescons the dekux dosnt really have any benift because you dont get any dlc not really worth the extra moneythe game kinda feels like the dlc is needed and perk mecaicsa dont work as well as they should along with game mecanics I.E nerfs and buffs change every update making the game have either too OP killers or too op surviors,
,ok game,
,Honestly the most fun I've had online in ages. Fast paced and very satisfying when you score an incredible goal or pull off that 'epic' save. A must have for everyone's library!,
,Great survival game. Got #1.8/11 would get another chicken dinner.,
,Great designed game. Makes a lot of fun!,
,The servers can't even keep 4 people in the same session or game for more than 5 minutes anymore. It's been happening for an entire month with people dcing halfway through quests constantly. Enough is enough.Don't buy this game unless you intend to play solo.,
,I am playing this game for 30 days now but this week it's insane... just now not more than 2 minutes ago it was the 3rd crash today!! Myt setup is preaty good i can say GPU GeForce GTX 970CPU Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 3350P CPU 3.10GHzMemory 16 GB RAM (15.95 GB RAM usable)Current resolution 1920 x 1080 60HzOperating system Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium ... and still is crashing!!

,Product received for free. its not my forte,
,I love open world games and this one is probably my favorite!,
,Loads of fun great community (for the most part) and always scare inducing!,
,Very fun to play definitely worth for its price,
,no,
,best game for players who love football and cars,
,all my hours come from the loading screen,
,Very Surprised with my laptop specs that this game can run perfectly! no flaws Nothing. Very fun game to play with friends but the people online are some of them. 10/10,
,love the concept but there's just too many cheaters and especially BUGS. devs should work on this game faster before they lose more players.,
,I rate this game an undisputable 10/10 it just has to be and here is why my friends. The community is rather toxic always ticks a box for me straight away Matchmaking not too bad of a problem coming in with a whopping 90% of the killers lobby dodging me because I'm one of those cool guys with a legacy item like it makes me pro DBD supposedly s My final reason (all though i have loads more but i don't want to bore you with an essay like most reviews) for recommending this fantastic game has to be the satisfaction of tea bagging and pallet looping against the killers to make them cry its just simply lovely to watch it don't half make me chuckle.,
,"I WANT LENNY SKIN C ON GUYS 6/10 why ? 60% of players are ""kill on sight"" and 60% is big number....",
,its ing grait game it worth 60$ thank R,
,Absolutely great game especially if playing online. The bad thing is it takes quite a lot of storage and lags a LOT if you have a bad computer.,
,First game that I've ever gone back and requested a refund. I'll stick to ARK thank you.,
,aww man i love this game so much!!!1 i think u shoukd buy this game. BUT ONLY IF U HAVE A GOOD PC! Love this! kEEp up the good work PUBG!!,
,Favorite and only sports game I play,
,Best game ever,
,I started playing GTA back when I was a lot younger. Vice City is what got me into the series however none of the other games caught my attention quite like 5 did. I played GTA IV a lot but never completed the campaign because I always got bored halfway through. GTA V on the other hand... I COULD NOT PUT DOWN. I love every aspect of it. (Other than the story not including more heists.) The 3 protagonists are thought out very well. They each have so much character and soul and rockstar packed in a great story to go with it. Just from the prologue I got instantly HOOKED! I would recommend this game to everyone and anyone no matter what games they're into. It's worth finishing at least once. (This is my 3rd time owning the game!) Rockstar did a great job with map design and their attention to detail is INCREDIBLE. So many little obscure details you wouldn't find in any other game that makes GTA V so unique. From the different sounds from cars squishing of wet shoes water only going up to the spot where you actually got wet. There's a lot of people who are whining about the game not getting campaign DLC. Would it have been nice? Sure! Who doesn't like extra content to their favorite games. HOWEVER for the longest time. When you bought a game that's exactly what you got. Despite that Rockstar did a damn well job with GTA V. It'll go down as one of my favorite games.,

,Perfect Gameplay.!,

,ITS GTA,
,Yes,
,IS a good game but with a bad computer you can't play this game then you need to play the beta other wise you just lost 20 $,
,LOADING SIMULATOR ONLINE Money is being earned slowly and everything is so expensive that it makes you buy Shark cards and Cheater and Modder on every corner .. R * does not have money for proper anti cheat protection ... pity,
,This game is literally the biggest pile of i have ever played. H1 is a tier 1 game compared to this boring cuck game.,
,Incredible for EA. No game makes your heart race like this one.,
,Great Animations. Awesome game play. Fantastic s*#t your pants moments. Hope they add TrackIR support in the near future.,
,best servers ever&lt 3+rep rip,
,Maybe it was its immersive gameplay or its gripping story... its well crafted characters immaculate design or addictive multiplayer. Whatever the reason the winner of 2018's Game of the Year Award is an instant classic.,
,This game... oh man where do I begin? This game even though it's still in alpha is a hell of a lot of fun. The thing I found fun in this game was trying to find my friends in this huge map it was extremely fun. I kept running into strangers who would sometimes give me stuff or attack me and take my stuff. Once I found my friends then the fun really kicked in. We ran around found some towns that were radiated and looted the buildings for some top notch items. The game is constantly updating with new stuff and I think I will keep playing this game even when the game fully releases. I highly recommend this for people who like survival games that aren't over the top realistic like DayZ.,
,Very funny and interesting game but I recommend you to buy it on sale .,
,Jesus Christ this game is a to play and I hate it so much I don't even know why I bought it.And it is just simply that that makes PUBG 1000x better than stupid Fortnite.,
,Very fun game,
,Product received for free. very good story game,

,Cool,
,pretty solid game for a alpha. rust is a game to watch,
,"GTA V was an awesome game in it's prime fun with friends alone and even with strangers. When I say ""in it's prime"" I mean the classic console versions not this PC version.Multiplayer There are many aspects I would talk about like the long long loading screens or the non existent balancing between high levels and low levels. But the problem that made me stop playing is that the concentration of cheaters is embarrassingly high I would join a open world server and I would say there's a 50/50 chance to meet a cheater. They would often be invincible and once in a while the cheater would annihilate EVERYBODY at the same time which could be up to 30 players depending if the server was full. Sometimes you would get lucky and get a friendly cheater who gives free money but that ruins the whole point of the game to earn money by doing jobs and spend it on upgrading your stuff. Now I also hear the game's developer firm ""Rockstar"" is trying to get rid of cheaters and removing ""illegitimately"" obtained money by going on a banning spree which resulted in innocent players getting banned as well as their in game money. Online GTA on PC is just unplayable.Singleplayer The singleplayer is what the past GTA games were but better. Big open world to explore with several different environments long and entertaining story to play through. But this is no where worth the 59.99 $ with that money you can buy two good games like PUB G &amp CS GO and still have left over money. I do NOT recommend this game on PC just stick to the console version.",
,Great game hampered by rampant hacking. Anti cheating measures are so woefully bad. When you commit to invest a 30 minute chunk of time to one round of a game only to be killed from across the map with a P1911 headshot while you have a helmet on... you know they have some work to do. In the last several days I've seen hackers in 25% of rounds. Sucking the fun right out...,
,good game,
,basically running simulator 2017,
,more cheaters,
,I only wish I had more friends to play with. This game is amazing made even better if you have 2 3 buddies to adventure with. 10/10 would reccommend.,
,Where do I even begin. This game is probably the most addicting game that I have ever played. There is so much to do and it is just so fun. The gunfights in this game are so surreal. They draw you in and feel like no other game ever has. You're afraid of losing everything you worked for. Then there is the otherside I hate this game with a flaming passion. It makes you want to eat your mouse and put a hole in your monitor but it always makes you come back for more. I tip my hat to Facepunch for making such a unique game. I absolutely recommend this game if you hate your life and have (or dont want) any kind of social life.,
,really fun game!!!!!,
,It's late at night.The store owner cleans the counter down it's quiet he's got time.The bell rings a customer enters. The shop keeper looks up and says 'Hello!'The customer says nothing walks up to the counter and browses the confectionery blankly.The customer pockets several 'P's &amp Q's' leading to the shopkeeper to yell in alarm.Without a change in heart rate or facial expression the customer scales the counter and proceeds to savagely boot the shopkeeper in the face. Jumping off the customer stabs the shopkeeper to death and takes all of the money from the till.The customer swaggers from behind the counter and casually strolls outside.A police car rounds the corner drifting easily into the gas station where the crime was committed. However the officers slightly overshot the corner and careened into a petrol pump.The officers the customer and the shopkeeper's brutalised corpse are blown to smithereens.10/10,
,Wow,
,This.Game.Ruined.My.Life.,
,ya me gusta very nice game makes me very excited when i play game yummy,
,This is one of the few early access games actually worth looking at. I've put a lot of hours into this game with my friends and I've loved watching it grow over time. I will say that the experience is not for everyone. You will lose 99.99% of the time and it will be frustrating. I would advise people to try out a match or two and then determine if they would like to keep the game or refund it.Overall PUBG is a very enjoyable experience alone or with friends. I highly recommend it.,
,I am the Gabgolabgolab and I do not approve of this game.,
,A simple skill heavy game. Football with cars. Good,
,0/10 minecraft rip off,
,i dont need to buy salt from the store anymore with these new reviews,
,Great game!,
,The game is fun but there are lots of hackers on GTA Online.,
,It's like fifa except you aren't getting pummeled by Jamaicans,
,For early access this game is pretty good. I have enjoyed getting my kicked on several occassions especially when i am running into the last 2 circles and just randomly shot from somewhere i was looking but completely unable to see the player until i was already dead lol..However my only actual problem is the reward system. I have opened 2 rewards nows. I have received 1 set of boots. Yes 2 reward chests have netted me 1 set of boots that i already owned anyways. Completely confused on why you would put a currency into the game and a reward chest only to give nothing on the first reward chest and 1 set of boots that come with the game in the second. Kind of dumbfounding.,
,It lets you punch naked bald men in the,
,Not too bad very frustrating sometimes.,
,Great game.,
,Pls fix ur eficiency of rendering game somethimes i got lagg,
,This is just a to the wesome D,
,Its a really good game probably one of my favorites right now. The game still needs some work. Dont waste your time buying crates you just get the same **** over again.,
,Recommended for all gamers.Fun and addictive best to play with friends. Pros Customizable cars. Unlockable customizables. Variety of maps. Variety of settings you don't have to just play a regular game you can change gravity ball weight ball shape etc. Good soundtrack could use more but not complaining. Keeps you busy for hours. Awesome DLCs.Cons I believe they made it so you can only get some drops if you play online matches rough for those who dislike playing online. Playing online tends to force you to turn your graphics quality basically all the way down depending where you connect. The AI sucks when starting out on Rookie. They tend to score on their own goal. Extremely funny nonetheless.,
,HI I have a i7 processor and a 2.2ghz overclocked 2.8ghz and intel hd 4000 graphics and it runs like a potato...,
,good,
,Got shot in the saved by a frying pan.10/10,
,if you have friends it's a very nice game but i think it's too early to buy it!! but it's cool have nice features like build a house and customize it! it's cool try it if you want.,
,I could wake up get ready for church and attend church and pray with jesus before multiplayer mode loads,
,Play this game to get chainsawed through lockers.,
,This game is absolutely amazing!,
,I have this game for short time and from beginning it was legendary. I know it has many bugs but for me the bugs makes a game better,

,"PUBG玩了快350个小时了 感慨颇深 I have played PUBG for 350 hours and I have lots of things to say.首先 这款游戏的确是好游戏 这一点我们必须承认 我的推荐是给这款游戏的 Firstly this game is really nice we must admit it.IT IS A GOOD GAME.但是现在PUBG的游戏环境实在实在是太差了 But the enviroment of this game is too bad.为什么 因为外挂 但是又不仅仅是因为外挂 Why?Because of those hackers.(But it's not just the bag of hackers).现在 PUBG里外挂已经十分猖獗了 加速 自瞄 透视 无后坐 锁血 甚至是路飞挂 一拳超人挂 Nowadays the hackers in PUBG are very rampant.Speeding up Automatic aiming perspective men no recoil Invincible men and even ""Monkey D Luffy"" hackers ""One Punch Man"" hackers!这些外挂严重破坏了我们的游戏体验 These hackers have destoried our experence of playing.但是我们对此无可奈何 But we have nothing to do about it.诚然 在PUBG里 90 以上的外挂都来自中国 Truely more than 90 hackers are from China in PUBG.虽然我无法代表全体中国人 但是我还是要向各位热爱PUBG的玩家说一声 对不起 Although I can't represent all of Chinese I still want to say to all of you who love PUBG SORRY.在中国 我们将这些开挂的人称为 孤儿 神仙 我真的希望那些孤儿别再做这样的烦人的事情 In China we call the hackers 'orphans' and 'gods' .I really hope those orphans do not do such annoying things in the game.哦对了 我来解释一下 孤儿 ""神仙 这两个词的含义吧 Oh I think I should tell you what's the meaning of them.孤儿象征着我们全体绿色玩家对开挂者的父母的亲切问候 这是在游戏里是一个贬义词 Orphans symbolize the cordial greetings of all us to the parents of those hackers.This is a derogatory word in the game.神仙代表外挂无所不能 在游戏里 'Gods' means they can do everything.(in game)我想让你们明白事是不是所有中国人都是开挂的 也不是所有中国人都进游戏就开始骂 CAO NI MA'的 I hope to let you understand that not every Chinese is hacker and not everyone who is in the game like to say'CAO NI MA' everywhere.虽然从整体上看 我们的素质的确不高 As a whole we do not have a high quality.但是这就是你们听到中文或者被打死就开始喊 曹尼玛中国人 的理由 But is it the reason of you to say 'Fu.ck you Chinese' when you hearing Chinese or be shot by us?????我们是真的很委屈 你们为什么这么做 We are really grieved.Why do you do this??我理解你们被挂打死的心情 但是我们也在被外挂怼啊 I comprehend your mood when you knocked down by hackers but we are shot by them too!现在我认为在PUBG里的有如下的这几种人 以爱国为理由恶意组队的红衣军 外挂 试图诛仙的玩家 骂中国人的玩家 骂外国人的中国人 一脸委屈关掉语音的中国人 起哄高喊 China NO.1""和 Taiwan NO.1""的外国人和事不关己的围观群众 I consider that there are these kinds of people in PUBG the Malicious teams of 'army with red clothes' and they usually use 'loving our country' to be their reason HACKERS players who want to kill 'gods' players who scold the Chinese Chinese who scold the other the Chinese who turn off the phonetics with Injustice faces foreigners booing and shouting ""China NO.1"" and ""Taiwan NO.1"" and a crowd of onlookers.也许大多数人听不懂现在中国人在广场和飞机上到底在说什么 Maybe lots of you can't understand what are Chinese speaking on the squae and the plane.我能给你们举出一些真实的例子 I can tell you some ture examples.谁在那边放歌 关上 Who is playing songs??!Switch off!能听得到么 Can you hear me?来 左右左右站着的是煞笔啊 站着的是煞笔 Come on!Left right left right the standing men are motherf.uc.k.ers.(this is a sentence of a song)机场卖挂 机场卖挂 Sell Sell how to be a hacker in airport sell sell (someone usually say this when he want to go to airport.Oh he must be very low.)是中国人的跳机场 中国人跳机场 紧接着会有一大群中国人开始骂这个喊话的 Flying to school if you are Chinese!Flying to school if you are Chinese!(and Then there will be a large group of Chinese start to scold the speaker.CAO NI MA fu.ck you bi.tch your head is broken?!)总之 希望你们理解 我们也很讨厌红衣军 外挂 我们也希望有一个绿色的游戏环境 All in all I hope you to know we don't like 'army with red clothes' and hackers.We wanna a green game environment.但是直到有一天 我突然看到有人说要锁中国区 steam上甚至出现了呼吁锁区的讨论组 But one day I suddenly find someone saying that please lock Chinese region!!!And there are even some groups appeal for LOCKING REGION???????当时我的心真的拔凉拔凉的 My heart was nearly frozen at that time.啊 的确 是我们不好 是中国的外挂太多了 Oh really.It's our bag there are too many Chinese hackers.但是我能确定一点 一旦锁区 PUBG就会变成第二个H1Z1 But if you do so PUBG will become the second H1Z1.而且外挂的数量肯定会变的更多 And the number of hacker will rise more.他们开得起一天 100的外挂 就用得起一个月 30的VPN They can use the program of hacker which spend them 100 per day they can have 30 per month VPN.而且如果锁区 就会给红衣军正当的理由 And if the region is locked it will give the Red Army a justifiable reason.所以 请不要锁区 这是一个真正热爱PUBG的中国玩家的心声 So please don't lock region this is the heart of a Chinese player who really loves PUBG.我的英语不是很好 我只是个学生 雅思5.0的水平(虽然已经能申请加拿大的大学了 My English is not good I am a student I only get 5.0 in IELTS. Although the mark is enough for me to apply for the university in Canada)如果有错的地方 请原谅我 If there are somthing wrong please forgive me.如果你真的理解我的这篇评测 请帮我顶上去 让更多的人看到这篇评测 If you really understand my review please help it to top up and let more people see this review.哦 还有 虽然我的头像很滑稽 但是我现在超认真的说 Oh what is more though my avatar is very funny I am very serious!!!!!谢谢qwq 233333333 emmmmmmmmmm wwwwwwwwwwwwThank you sir as.s we can",
,Decent addition to the GTA series. The game play was ok and the graphics were ok. The game was buggy about half way through and I just stopped playing because I didnt want to start over. End of the day I give this GTA a 7/10.,
,Except for the optimization issues a great game. 3 million people can't be wrong.(That's what they said about Donald Trump).,
,Greate Game. The makers are the makers of Garry's Mod and so far they have put allot of effort into this though it still seems as if they are unsure of which direction they want to go with the game. This game has good potential but I haven't played it in a long while since I have lost my appeal towards it. I have trust in the maker that it will come back around.,
,Good game some bugs but that's not a problem for an early access game. I love the feel of the guns in the game they feel realistic. I would definitely recommend this game over H1Z1. It This game is like so much better. The guns feel better the weather the graphics the gameplay. Well Cheers Mate.,
,Great game ruined by greed.,
,they add more skins than fixing the stupid game,
,Nice ING game you ing SPERGLORD HIT. Holy it pisses me off when some unoriginal assholish dickweed decides it would just be ING HILARIOUS to make the SAME. OVERUSED. GAME. What do you even ing hope to gain out of this? Karma? Well you're certainly getting that cause it seems like a lot of other inbred ing autistic are thinking you're just ING HILARIOUS and that this GAME HASN'T BEEN MADE A BILLION ING TIMES. you.,
,Never come across a hacker. Lag is minimal but is dependant on so many connectivity factors it's unfair to blame Bluehole/PUBG Corp. It's a lot of fun. It's not the final ever version so expect future refinements. It's come a LONG way since the beginning of Early Access.tl dr Quit yer whining.,
,I was unrightfuly banned for 30 days and reset all becasue a piece of hacker/modder,
,Fired at someone two times got fired back at 500 times. 2/500 would fire again.,
,this game bbad,
,I leik,
,Naked people everywhere,
,While the progress from legacy is impressive the game itself seems to play as follows SpawnFind a tree (you might have to run for up to 5 minutes to get to one)Make a mapMake better tools if you happen to find stoneGet killed while harvesting for tier 2 tools (if you weren't spotted by someone with firearms or a wolf during the previous steps)Can't give it a thumbs up anymore.,
,good game.,
,Yes.,
,blueba.. you know ),
,I origanlly downvoted this game but now that they are releasing the 1.0 update and i actually played it on the test servers. I would recommened this to any BR fan. I just hope they fixed the server stability issues.,
,nice game,
,Ha what,
,#REGION LOCK CHINAbeen playing fps games since cs 1.6 till cs go and other worthy mentions like rainbow six siege l4d2 and battlefield was excited when pubg first came out since it offers a new competitive shooting game. took me nearly a few weeks to learn the controls the map layouts and even though i enjoy playing on solo memorable moments is playing with my friends till we even opened a discord channel so we can communicate in game better. however sadly to say this game is trash now. due to the fact that there are too many hackers currently i left 3rd person to play in ffp since there are less hackers but its all the same now. countless times we end up dying to hackers and its always the same nickname the same china pandatv nickname or some random numbers . this game is utter rubbish. we should just boycott it its either no recoil hacks esp hack or speed hack. the people at blueballs company ain't doing anything. just taking money and wiping china butt hole,
,yes,
,Can I get a refund?,
,Really a good game to enjoy!,
,Good idea best game for fun,
,Buy $30 worth of bullets and shoot your tiny brain out for even thinking about buying this game,
,This is the best game for teamwork you can play as a survivor and play with your friends or you can play as a killer and kill your friend orrandom people. 10/10,
,frustrating but fun.,
,game the devs,
,Very addictive game when playing online multiplayer. One game is 5 minutes it always fits in when you have a bit of spare time left.Also this game is very cool when you are having friends over. You can play with 4 people with controllers on a big screen really nice.,
,The game will not work 4/5 times (it keeps crashing). Then the few times I do get on it was not very noob friendly at all. There needs to be a short built in start up area for people to learn the rope before they are let in the wild. If the game would run without crashing I might of given it a better chance but I feel like I wasted my money DO NOT BUY.,
,i cannot play this game THIER IS a problem themide is is letting me do re inStall,
,I think this is a very good game and i think everyone should get the game,
,Apart from annoying login proccess each time you visit loby very positive effort if you like solo or teamplay survival based game which keeps you on your toes PUBG is the answer despite being an Alpha however more game modes and play areas/maps would be great.,
,poo,
,Looting suspense action.. can do almost anything in this game..! Something about dropping 100 players on a large remote island to duke it out or have 4 player teams is awesome. Every round is different. Listen for footsteps or shots fired and watch out! Sometimes the play mechanics can be difficult but overall with the superb graphics and varied scenes the game is playable for hours and hours. Add a 4th map and would be worth $59.99 easily..!! Join in and have fun.. winner winner chicken dinner!!,
,with just over 600 hours into the game and playing from it's early days i seen this games good days and bad. i played with people from all over the world (not by choice on that one..) it saddens me to say that i am finally giving up on PUBG. i been watching this game over the past few months waiting for it to get fixed but non the less i dont see it coming. the game started off with 14 million players and well 13 mill band due to multiple reasons. (recoil not being there targeting auto locking nothing but head shots ect) and with this latest patch it still hasn't gotten better they are still causing people to pay for crate and skins to help fill there pockets even more (was 14 million people buying the game at 40$ not enough for you?) more so even more bugs are still popping up the latest with this review is the servers. get into a match and at 7 seconds on the timer till match start the 80+ people are lagged out and sent to the main screen.i really wouldn't recommend this myself however at this point im giving up on this game and dare i say it...and i really dont want to i would rather buy call of duty and even suggest others for there battle royal over trying to find a half a** good match here,
,STUPID ING PIECE OF,
,Hunt some monsters get some bones grind them,
,Having quite a bit of trouble just to get the game to run. Hoping a refund is possible even if the time is over the two hour or so limit. Haven't even been able to play it. When I try to run it with steam it says the launch was failed so hopefully an update will help.,
,Great game very fun to play especially with teammates. Recommended.,
,Game is pretty fun. Ranking system is kinda bogus and the community is pretty toxic. I'm still here tho so,

,Hell yeah!!!...8/10,
,SCREW THE UPDAATE,
,Greedy Bunghole,
,Updates are constantly released during prime time instead of off time. This alone deserves a downvote.,
,The removal of the zombies took away a huge element to the game. I know they don't want to be a zombie survival game just a survival game which is fine. But bring in something new/different like dinosaurs or something. The engine and fine and I don't mind the alpha the game just needs a direction.,
,It is a very fun game. A lot of cars with customizations you can play for hours and hours.This game is awesome. If you were like me and couldn't decide whether to buy it or not I suggest buying it. It won't let you down.,
,ø,
,Best game I've bought on steam so far.,
,Product received for free. Good game plebs XDEEEE ),
,This is a absolutely stunning game. This game Player Unknown's Battlegrounds is truely amazing. I have enjoy'd every second I have had in game. The graphics are amazing and the realism of the game is breath taking. I have nothing bad to say about the game.,

,"I've played 64 hours of Rust most of them in what's now called Legacy. What seems to be a ""throw everyone in an empty world"" simulator it ends up being most appropriately compared to human fecies. We've had alot of fun mostly due to funny bugs and ugly animations. Two hours after joining a server starting with nothing but a stone in your hand and a torch in your bag you feel like you've ""completed the game"". You're now seated in an impenetrable fortress with 30 000 wood in your chest and 10 furnaces running an industrial smelting operation. And you can craft everything in the game.As far as a survival games goes this really is comparable to human fecies animals can't attack you Zombies are removed. Gathering metal from one vein gives you metal for days and 10 trees chopped down would suffice for building an impenetrable house.",

,This Is a great game great idea... except for connection issues. every other game I own runs just fine online but when it comes to puk bg it just has so many issues when trying to enter the game I have great internet and a solid personally built compuer but no mater what there are issues when trying to enter the game initially or trying to enter a match Ive had things happen where it just freezes on the loading screan until im almost hitting the ground and habe thenworst position to not loading at all then theres the issue that once you land the buildings do not load despite the map never changing I've owned the game for three or four months and still no changes it only gets worse it actually ran better when it first came out. this game is not worth the money they are charging for it anymore and with the money they have made you would think they would have improved on this but alas there seems to be no hope for improvement. I'm just about done with dealing with it. not worth the money there are plenty of games similar that you can get that don't have these issues and have other game modes.,
,I like the long loading screen for multiplayer D lots of tips.,
,Please put on an SSD.,
,The only this that is trash is how you get suspeded from online or not I got suspeded from gta online untill 8/28/18 for know ing reason,
,the best game,

,If you like the game Minecraft You'll definatly love this game! Just like it in many ways!,
,Recommended ... but with CAUTIONMake no mistake this is a brilliant game strategy adrenalin combat ...CAUTION ... this game is quite demanding on your PC so make sureyou have the minimum requirements to run it.,
,Just **** off... You demolished your own creation.,
,Awesom,

,Top D!,
,Product received for free. Mann this game is good,
,I like,
,This game is fun and has potential but the devs have already broken thier promise. Asking us for more money even though thier game is not finshed. Now its $2.50 for a key soon to be Buy now and get a 4x scope at the beggining of every game. I hope this ing game burns down and looses everything so that we may set an example. Us gamers are not respected. Battlegorunds has sullied itself.,
,I have a couple hours and so far its really fun to play 10/10 would recommend,
,Pros Sort of Dark Souls Gameplay you need to learn your enemies movements to improve Good customization and loot Freedom to change weapons at any point Beautiful scenarios and monsters As a biologist really liked the Ecology studies in the game Collecting plants bugs minerals etc. is really easy and fluidCons PC is always a big step behind from consoles (which is the reasons for most downvotes) Sort of repetitive track and kill monster loot improve track and kill bigger monster loot improveIf it fits your style it wont let you down its a damm good game,
,Very fun game just needs to have the DLC on PC version I'd say.,
,Not the best of reputations as a developer but this game keeps you coming back with a fork and knife for that chicken dinner. So as long as they update it and add more guns maps and vehicles this game will be a new CS GO. One of the best parts of this game is the randomness of it. The fact that you can ride a bike over a mountain through an upstairs window and kill a squad is absolutely insane. Definitely the best battle royale on the market currently.,
,Swinging my pick over my shoulder sweat sticking to my neck I grab the last few pieces of stone needed for the upgrade from wood to stone.It had been a few long hard days to get to this point gathering wood stone and metal.However it will be worth it when I get back to be able to sleep at night without worrying someone might knock down the door.As I climbed the hill back towards my homestead the smell of thick black smoke filled the air and then I saw it.Rising from my house.The sound of hysterical laughter filled my ears as three men wearing make shift armour emerged from the burning corpse of my once loved home.I watched the house crumble to the ground unable to move unable to pay attention to anything else.Before I knew it a sharp agonising pain filled my body.A drop to my knees then fall into a thick puddle of crimson.As I lay there unable to hold the screams of pain in listening to the laughter of three men I watched as the colour slipped from my vision the last few remains of my hard work crumble to ashes in the flames of hatred and then... There was nothing.10/10 would watch my hopes and dreams burn again,
,best game eva,
,dont get me wrong i love this game but the one thing icannot deal with is the dysync and lag and mostly because all the asian/japanese counrtys play on the OC severs and completely ruin the gameplay experiece when they have there own severs to play on why wreck it fur us aussys i get less lag playing on NA then i do OC and im from australia please make this game regien locked or youll just the game even more,
,Game is still in a catastrophic state... the updates are like sometimes they make it better sometimes they make it worse... instead of fixing all problems there is more focus on new content... sometimes its impossible to say if they people are cheating or the game is that bad (bugs deathcam .....) they made so much money with this.... and there are so many problems left since early access (ticking rate with servers is in some countries much worse than in other games).............still too many problems left with this gameAnd wth why this twich streamer &amp %($ skins and clothes that is the most unnecessary thing this game needed!!!!!!,
,I havent ever gotten too far into this game but when I manage to find time to play. its a good laugh.,
,only game ill start over and repeat the same 2 day process before losing it all again on the third,
,Pretty good overall many good updates coming out each month. Solo is a chore so get some friends to play with you and prepare for the toxic community.,
,My game keeps crashing and idk what to do,
,i need healingYou have died outside of playzone.,
,"Best ""I wish we could do this in a private session"" sim out there.10/10",
,For me as a PC and Switch player who can't get his hands on God of War and RDR2 this is the best Game 2018. It started with a clueless but hyped beginning and boy did it deliver. The monsters the weapons the music they alone make this game a masterpiece in which you can invest hundreds of hours and still want to keep on hunting.There where a few issues at the beginning of the release on PC but now it works perfectly fine and we should be grateful to got such a great port for this game.It brought me to the monster hunter franchise and made it one of my favorites right behind Dark Souls.So try it play it master it if you like big weapons epic fights and always want to get better this is your game!,
,Yeah it's pretty good.,
,The game crashed after I died where i would of lost a crystal and when i loaded back it was still therethe next game the lobby declared me a cheater. Please fix your detection system.edit So apparantly its not me thats the issue its everyoneEvery single lobby i connect to or invite i get it disconnects everyone saying that its cheatingwether its play as suvivor survive with friends be a killer and kill your friendsquick play included.Edit2 Lobbies are now working however everyone's ranks have been set back to 20,
,I have completed the game to 100% I've got every possible item unlocked all tofus and got the best rankings in the game. My only advice is for people who are worried about not having enough content there is definitely enough to enjoy the game many many times. You cannot compare the scale of this to an online shooter or a sandbox RPG because it's nothing like those games. The value of this game is the same as when you play a story driven single player that you binge for a while and if you like it enough (like most fans) you'll go back to the game later simply because you love the game not because theres more to do. Anyone who says the game is too hard or the controls are difficult to master go play minecraft or get better( I died loads of times).,
,Devs make improvements but leave much to be desired. There have been significant improvements from EA but for a fully released game for $30 it isn't completely worth it. The first few games will be fun but after a while playing the same map (2 maps now) it will get repetitive. Also at the time of this review the North American server is still FLOODED with individuals speaking Chinese. This is a team based game where communication is vital. I have not noticed hacking since it has been fully released but I do not doubt that it is still a present issue for others.,
,Absoultely unplayable online services with nothing but 12 year old modders running around destorying your cars. CEO's randomly losing connection therefor failing any heists. We were even promised single player DLC but nope instead we got hundreds of new cars and colorful sh*t that led to online becoming trash.,
,Freddy is too OP.Do not buy if you want to deal with that.It is unbalanced. It is stupid. Until they change this I can't recommend it.,
,Game feels so good to play great game love it i came from dayz but it has a h1z1 and dayz feel combined worth it 100% all the way minor con it is in early access so there is server lag frequently but not to big.,
,I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR (STEAM) I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET A GAME TO WORK FOR MY SON.. I HAVE EXPLAINED TO THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT THAT WE WOULD LIKE A REFUND..OR AT LEAST A TECH TO CALL ME AND SEE IF WE CAN RESOLVE THE ISSUE I HAVE SPENT OVER 3 HOURS TRYING TO INSTALL AND LAUNCH THIS GAME THROUGH MULTIPLE SERVERS AND NOTHING IS WORKING ALL YOU HEAR IS THE MUSIC IN THE BACK GROUND.. CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS SAYING I HAVE MORE THAN 2 HOURS OF PLAY TIME SO NO REFUND.. I KNOW IF THEY CAN SEE WE WERE LOGGED IN FOR 2 HOURS THEN THEY CAN SEE WE HAVE NOT ACTUALLY GOT INTO A GAME AT ALL SINCE PURCHASED... HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.. IF THIS IS NOT RESOLVED i WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANTHING FROM STEAM AGAIN.. THE GA GAME IS CALLED RUST..,
,soccer + cars best game ever,
,Here is simply my one perspective This games is so wonderful. I sincerely can't wait to see what you guys bring us down the line. In the meantime.. I'm really enjoying this game. Thank you so much for investing your time and creativity into it.Praise be to he who lets us close the capsule door during sandstorms.,
,Such an amazing game )Really recommend it for sure!,
,good game!!!,
,Gret multiply game u have to learn much things if u want to be a great player,
,I think the best GTA is that one. Both online and singleplayer modes are really fun to play. Another good thing is that the developers keep updating the game. The only bad thing is there are too much cheaters in the multiplayer section.,
,First MH game ever to familiarise me with the series. It's niche but does have it's issues. However if you manage to look aside them the game is quite enjoyable although a tad small (from what I've heard).,
,With the recent desync fix the game is actually fun.,
,Man they really the bed on this game. Shake my head.,
,Git gud nub,
,No more Mods?,
,Its awsome game and i love the feel of it,
,Fix PUBG best campaign. 10/10,
,NICE,
,Well worth $20,
,Monster Hunter World is both an entry point in the series for an audience who have only ever heard of the monter slaying slasher and a remake of the formula for an age old series that has fans of both the west and east joining together to explore the new world.As a long time fan of the series I was both excited and cautious of this instillation in the series due to its major change in both platform and gameplay. The open world aspect of each map seemed like both a dream and curse as I explored new rich environments and quickly learnt that the vastness could be my downfall in a fight. Although the new maps and world as a whole are a challenging change in mechanics and strategy the beauty of a small enclosed beach or a view over a vast lush forest can leave you lost for words during a difficult hunt.The veriety in weapons hasn't changed since the last title however the way that weapons are presented has changed considerably. Each weapon being in your box from the start like in every start to a MH Game but the practice area allows for in depth training that can make a world of difference when learning a new weapons style. As this is a new world that also means new monsters which will also lead to a new array of weapon and armor match ups all of which in the later game can be mixed to boost specififc stats and allow you to hunt to your full potential.The multiplayer is also heavily sold for hunts in both the story and in the Gathering hub for more advanced hunters allowing you to team up with friends or just friendly hunters to get through a hunt with ease. This doesn't however limit the solo experience as the difficulty level will increase with every added hunter leaving no solo hunter at a disadvantage to a monster should they choose to go it alone.In conclusion Monster Hunter World is a sensational step forward for the franchise showing advanced graphics on both console and PC and a system that can be sustained through teams or solo artists to achieve the very best results in a hunt. The game is gripping from A Z and although there can be some slow slopes to the story during investigation sections these all link to a greater mission that will prove to be a challenge to any capable hunter.10/10 would put far too much of my free time into this game again.,
,Although it is in development it is one of my favorites games and the best survival game ever highly recommended ...!!,
,Well done like steak ),
,good game i like it,
,+ good game setting ty graphics ty netcode frequent server maintenances for may hours got a random ban today as many others took almost day to get unbannedgame is almost dead good competitors are coming,
,Amazing game.,
,Rocket League is an alright game. But when the developers take away one of the primary reasons to play video games the game suffers greatly. You see many people use games as an outlet for stress or to get away from their troubles and when the devs ban them for simply insulting another player you know something is up. This is an extreme overreaction and illogical way to handle the problem. I got a 24 hour ban for this reason that only started when I entered the game again. I got banned from a game for saying something insulting. Not muted. Banned. BANNED. REALLY DUDE. This makes no sence at all especially when the person getting insulted could just mute me. If you really did want to help you could add a filter on the chat that once a swear word or insulting word goes through it it asks the other team if they want to mute the other user. This would be toggleable obviously. I cannot back this game that bans people for insulting others. That is the most outragous strategy for removing toxic players. Such a wuss approch and I HATE IT. It blows me away how the devs thing that I deserve my 24 hour GAME ban. I deserve at CHAT ban at the very most. If they really cared just ban the player from chatting entirely after a few times. A game ban is too far.About the game itself The game suffers from what CS GO suffers from. You will see someone who on your screen obviously did not hit the ball hit the ball. That is because of the server tickrate. The fact that this is so noticable is truly unacceptable.,
,Good!,
,The Single Player has loads of potential to get a good experience out of it. The best way to unlock is too use mods to make it a) better looking b) better to play and c) more enteraining. I have played loads of single player as I don't bother with online (450 hours) and I still love the game to this day it's truly astonishing!,
,This game is great if u dont have alot of time or when u dont want to think to much.Its also a nice game to do with ur kids ( well i do they like it alot ) 10/10,
,One of my top 5 all time games. Devs are active every week with quality updates. I've had it since it came out and still play it. It's worth it it you play with a group of friendsEDIT this games anti cheat is completely horrible and failed me i got banned for absolutley no reason and when i emailed EAC about it they said i broke the rules and cheated and will never be unbanned i dont not recommend this game to anyone do not buy it the anti cheat wasted 2.2k hours of my life and over 100$ in skins terrible game do not buy itEDIT I GOT UNBANNED THE GAMESGREAT EVERYONE BUY IT,
,Like every other other review says the campaign is 10/10.But that's only half the game. Online is a very fun with days of content and it's a great time with friends. Hackers are a problem but most of the time i'll just find a new session and avoid them. And a lot of the newer content is very expensive but you don't need to buy everything in the game just working for the stuff you want and it makes this a very rewarding game.,
,it's skyrim but with paid mods.,
,IF u like chasing/tracking and sharpening this is for u.if u like fighting large monsters well u will spend no time doing that in this game. as they run as soon as u have done damge to them.also i feel the coop part of the game feels like it came from 2008,
,"The amount of fun I had on this game was insane yes there are a few people who ruin the experience in some matches by leaving early or just be a**holes but hey isn't that all online games?Pro tip nothing strikes fear into the heart of killers more than ""The Helicopter"" (picture a downed survivor spinning on the spot like a rotor blade).",
,devs to put it shortly.How about those Mods eh?/Hah/.,
,The game might be a little twisted from the killers point of view but if you don't like to slash people's guts out of there body then just don't play killer! I have almost 200 hours now but half of those hours are afk hours but the 100 hours I have actually played i've enjoyed! So if you're looking to get this game I hoped I helped &gt,
,Best when play with your friends!!!,
,GJ Take Two Interactive ... All modding used by OpenIV is for singleplayer use only to make the game more enjoyable the software OpenIV was never used to mod multiplayer or Grand Theft Auto Online so it does not harm anyone.Edit OpenIV is alive D,
,Product received for free. Funny game to play with friends. Some times buggy but had a blast most of the time I played it. I Dont play it anymore.,
,"PUBG is another ""Real is Brown"" deathmatch shooter. 100 people last man standing wins.You jump out of a plane loot a house then get shot by someone you didn't see.OrYou jump out of a plane loot a house run from the electric wall of death for 15 minutes and then get shot by someone you didn't see. Assuming the death wall didn't kill you first.At $30 it's WAY overpriced. Extremely buggy very little customization only one large map crawling with cheaters impossible to figure out mechanics and everything comes down to who gets the best camping spot.Frustrating and not at all fun. Not sure why people love this game so much except that it's streamer bait.Edit Now with Microtransactions. &gt _&lt Edit 2 I requested a refund and was refused.Edit 3 The game has gone live and it is still just as bad as it was before but now all the weekly items are locked behind microtransactions. So congrats Bluehole for making this game suck even more than during EA.",
,Best game i have played to date would 10/10 recommend,
,Game is fun Until you go over the ping limit and it freezes your game. Some people cant get perfect internet. So for people who have bad internet with lag spikes it can cause you to lose. Just lost because the game froze me after ping went over the allowed amount and I died to the circle. It is a dumb idea for the game to freeze if your ping goes to high. Would be such an awesome game if it didnt have this feature coming from someone who has bad internet,
,Easy to play so hard to master,
,Don't really like the story in this game it is just not that interesting to me. I can't really sympathize with the character like I could in GTA IV. Not to mention the whole several playable characters thing just isn't something I really like either I preferred it where you just played as one person rather than several.,
,Just bought it already LOVE it!,
,קררראוראוו,
,The game is not finnished. I get some stuttering I get ocasional crashes I get weird bugs and sometimes my car hovers in the air like it's from another world. However I havent gotten this wrapped up in a game this fast since I was young. This has everything I've always wanted. Massive map customizable weapons and a huge group of players. This game gives you the most tangible feeling of anxiey and fear. Even pros will sometimes find that they die almost instantly. Its great. As long as the improvements keep coming I reccomend this game.Edit RIP this game,
,doesnt even launch anymore.cant even get my free dolly clothes.,
,There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said. GTA V will go down in history as one of the most amazing and played games of all time.,
,please fix all cheat,
,Bring back mods,
,เป นเกมท ด มากสน กจร งๆขอให ผ พ ฒนาทำด ต อไปเป นกำล งใจให ขอบค ณคร บ,
,Tons of issues with this game right now. #1 Issue is network connection. Although this was present in the console version it's even worse here. Some sound files get glitched and just continue to play through out the quest. There's a horrible screen tear at the bottom that sticks for a moment if you get out of the menu too quickly. This game is simplfied from the previous Monster Hunter games to get new players into the series (I find this okay however if you're looking for G Rank and more challenge. Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate is coming soon.) Good things to note Looks gorgeous Runs at 1080p60fps or better with a decent PC Lots of fun I personally love this game but if someone was on the fence about this game... I would wait for a sale unless these issues get fixed. In the meantime I suppose I'll enjoy solo hunting. Once I've given this a few hundred hours of gametime I'll update this review for the integrity of the game.,
,Game is very fun but players are very toxic.,
,I hopped on the bandwagon and I cant get off,
,GREAT FU*KING GAME go to the coast get together have some laughs kill some,
,Guys you all are rating a game badly because you downloaded a mod that the developers said you cant download. Its like me putting a roach on ice cream then blaming the ice cream maker. its stupid.,
,20/10 had this on xbox liked it that much i got it on pc regret nothing,
,This game is crazy fun and super Intense.,
,Good Game If You Get Mad Easy. Very Calming,
,I just realized i haven't reviewed this game yet. So here it goes This game is a masterpiece. Pure and simple.,
,Winner winner chicken dinner!,
,Most updated game I ve ever played. The developers are very down to earth and updates are weekly and they all always add something to the game. The gameplay is the most realistic gun game ever. The scenery is beautiful even on the worst possible settings. The only negative is the community and how difficult this game is. You will tilt playing this game because it s very hard to get moving on but servers.,
,I like the game even if I am not good at it. It has a competitive mode and this is what I don t like cuz soon the community of this game will be as the csgo community but for now it is very nice,
,10/10 would get floored by a shotgun again,
,Noice gaem.,
,First time I bought a game in early access but this is the most addicting game I played alone and friends. every round is really unpredictable and you always need to be in your toes. Devs does deliver their updates and so far optimization is improving! looking forward on this game getting better. devs are promising content and I hope they look at getting cheaters banned.,
,can ye tell me why its not woring i have lots of memory but its still not working,
,This game is the best purchase anyone will ever make in their life.,
,good game,
,If you preordered this game you got ed in the . After getting I started playing GTAV ONLINE PC because that's what this version is called *facepalm*. There are so many menus and loading screens that I actually became a smoker just while I played this game. The AI is so incredibly stupid it makes you want to just stop breathing. Every single online lobby you get into will have modders however if you attempt to even the playing field you will get banned either permanently or for months. Every 3 days single player stops functioning for about 3 days so if you don't want to play with modders online then you can only play half of every week because of the extremely EXTREMELY stupid patching system. They make their own game unplayable every week. Makes me incredibly sick to my stomach that I spent money on these clowns. Don't buy this game don't play this game. Don't talk about this game don't stream this game don't pull up a vod. GTAV came out a long time ago and the rerelease is an abomination.,
,Bu zamana kadar yapılmış en iyi GTA oyunu!,
,low tick rate servers. constant crashes after 1.0. hackers still everywhere. no region lock for the chinese. your dev team is awful and cares little about fixing the game and only cares about adding content which will cause more problems. no matter what i say it wont change anything either because this tumor continues to grow by the millions. im still going to play but it will never be the game i always wished it would become. absolutely terrible developers,
,Love this game,
,Wow!What a save!Wow!Calculated.,
,UnBEARable.,
,The game is lots of fun... when it runs but it freezes more than an industrial grade freezer I have at this time 14 hours played and 40+ crashes and freezes. About 30 of them are from multiplayer but i paid $70 ing dollars for this game and I expect it to work. The game is looks great the cars are still made of helium and first person mode gives me a headache. Untill these crashing issues are fix I would not recommend getting.,
,It's a great concept,
,really fun game would definitely recommend it it can be tilting to play sometimes but the concept is outstanding there is some glitches but its not tthat bad the upgrade system is so unique and the perks are also great. there is also constant updates and events so it almost never gets old. tho its a bit annoying that you need to buy dlc's to get some of the killers and survivors but its not a must to have all the dlc's.,
,Very very spicey memey game and love it i recommend u get this game is spicymems,
,Enjoyable if you wanna play solo don't buy it its better with friends,
,Can't really say much as i just bought it yesterday. But from the one game i have played (which by no suprise i lost but i scored 3 goals!) i think this game is amazing and worth the money!,
,Spent two weeks (my time) on rust getting to a gun...the dying because the only animals are incredibly terrifyingManaged to find a guy to help me and we got up to guns and a houseWe were walking around when he makes a smartass remark to a guy with a pipe shotgunWe both dieNever refound friendHad to start over,
,And now this game is totally like the free mobile f*u*c*king game,
,Good luck making friends in this game everyone you see will kill u with no hesitation. still really fun game to grind and play with friends. Toxic community is the only down side and getting gang by 20 people can leave you pretty mad. if you can see past this tho i would recomend rust,
,Like a dating simulator except each game is like a first date but destined to end terribly.10/10 would rage quit after team speaks enough english to yell China #1 again.,
,very good very entertainmening,
,Toatally worth the price. Don't touch the game RockStar it works.,
,The servers were fixed. The game runs pretty well on minimum specs and anyone still complaining just haven t turned off Volume Rendering Quality which is the fps killer.General info Monster Hunter World is the fifth game in the series not including the g rank versions or spin offs of the other games where you hunt well Monsters and take their skin and wear it with a continuing cycle until you rage quit or you re done.Gameplay The gameplay is good and enjoyable like in the previous titles. With multiple weapons the game offers multiple game styles for all kind of players like the long sword for weebs dual blades for no skill people hammer for people that want to play whack a mole greatsword for THATS A LOT OF DAMAGE and the best weapon THE SWORD AND SHIELD THAT CAN BASICALLY DO EVERYTHING WITH NO PROBLEMS etc. Then comes armor skills that have multiple gamestyle changing abilities like wide range makes you a support making you able to use your own items that would normally only heal and buff you to buff and heal your team mates but the skills come into play in High rank and are really important to either make the monster you re fighting easier or to make a set to rek with the greatsword.Story The story is really meh as in I liked Monster hunter 4 Ultimate s a lot more for having an enjoyable cast of character with personality other than Look at me I curious about everything and I do nothing else useful than give you quests and try to kill myself in every cutscene in the game forcing you to fight the monster I almost got killed by or kill you in the process.Some things for newbies This game is the easiest in the series by far with multiple quality of life changes and other improvements like gathering is a LOT faster than in previous games and other changes that make the game less grindy and easier which makes this the most newbie friendly from the seriesFew gripes I just have a few gripes with the game like how there isn t G Rank or how I get poisoned by Rathalos more than Pukei Pukei and how I hate the puffball.End thoughts The game is good but it has a few problems that can mostly be ignored so buy it on sale but if you want the game right now I d say buy it somewhere else for cheaper.,
,99% mechanical skill1% game sense,
,Not that keen on solo mode but duo and squad mode are so good with friends. Amazing!,
,So far I am enjoying this game Online is definately the highlight.,
,its so good the preformance problems are now goneand its getting better by the moment,
,Interesting and competitive game!,
,Awesome game,
,Great Game,
,Those annoying bugs in online is merduring this game,
,In my opinion the best and most true Resident Evil game to date. It's scary has good atmosphere good controls constantly surprises you and plays like butter peep the slow cutter.9/10 buy it only the b scenario is to samey to the first run through.,
,Not bad match making is terrible like any pvp games. Not sure why i'm matched against some seasonal champions.,
,Fun game to play Every month,
,"This game rocks. It totally does. If you watched gameplay from this game and thought ""hey this kinda looks fun!"" you literally HAVE to try it it's like a bajillion times better than you think it can be.",

,it's k,
,This game is wicked once u learn the basics ur set on the greatest adventure ever ) just keep a look out for raiders and bandits gd luck,
,it's alright,
,rip hackerbux c,
,Game 'released' from early access. Plauged by more lag issues than before particlarly on the new Miramar map. Which is made even more annoying by being thrown into games on the new map 5x more often than the old map. Great game to play if you can actually play it but server connection issues are abhorrent. Also the new fancy party screen takes 3x longer to load into than the previous one after exiting a game. The grass and car are pretty but I dont want to spend a minute staring at it before the game connects to the server.Calling this anything but early access is a sham. The game still has a long way to go in terms of netcode and optimisation ebfore being deemed a full release. It was simply released so they could say it was and stop people complaining about hgow long it would otherwise have taken.,
,After several amazing years of modding it is cruel and entirely unecesary to take it all away like this. There was little to no research done on Take 2's end when they sent the cease and decist letter. I hope Take2 learn from this monumental mistake and backpedal moving on as a smart company.,
,lol how many of the negitive reviews have 100+ hours played,
,Definitely worth the price!,
,now the free expansions are nice but banning mods first for online and now for singleplayer is mad. they just try to squeeze as much money out of players by making the already expensive game hard to grind in online forcing people to buy shark cards.and now they force people to play more online by basically making the singleplayer boring after completing the story mode.they probably did not expect this backlash.,
,Best game and music,
,Rocket powered vehicles try to score goals and win matches. Doesn't get any simpler than that (Seriously it's an awesome sports/arcade game which is a lot of fun especially playing with friends).,

,Product received for free. Best games to play with friends!,
,banned several times for just being on the same server as someone whos modding. won't buy a rockstar games ever again. rockstar should understand that banning people permanently in a game that costs 60 dollars is an unacceptable reaction to people using dumb mods. oh well.,
,I like it,
,Fun game but its so poorly optimized and weapons are broken asf sometimes u can kill them in 2 shots and sometimes with the same guns and them having same armour and health u can shoot like 10 bullets into them and they dont die!,
,"Rust is my all time favorite game. It brings me the most joy adrenaline and stress of anything I've ever played. The ability to succeed is based on experience skill and trust. It is the ultimate PvP experience and with the way the team over at Facepunch rolls out updates it's only uphill from here.Experience allows you to know which walls to hit with C4 how to sleep in that bush while you have the Airdrop on you and how to build a near impenetrable base. Skill is used to wield various weapons and know your limits when matching up against people. Can you kill those 4 nakeds chasing after you with only a spear and a hatchet on you? That's your call. Trust lies in the people you surround yourself with. Rust is an almost completely unpredictable game because you have no idea how people are going to react to the way you play. Killing that silly naked who wanted some food for free may have seemed like a hilarious idea at the time but maybe not so much when he shows up with 20 friends in full gear to your front door. And allowing that guy access to your whole base after you've only known him for 2 hours? I can tell you from experience it's not fun to log on and find that your base is no longer yours. They let me know that loud and clear as they screamed at me over their mics )Be friendly or be mean it's your call either way you have the ability to succeed immensely or end up homeless.PROTIPS Throwing spears are op AK is best gun pipeshotty is best gun for the poor don't build next to a spawn find some friends don't be too friendly don't eff with a clan unless you can back it up wall off your toolcupboard have an ""airlock"" in your front entrance pillars are 100% worth sharing sleeping bags saves 2 hours trying to find your friend if you wear clothes you will get shot 90% of the time if you're naked you will get shot 50% of the time everyone can hear you c4 people saying ""friendly"" almost never are nakeds aren't always what they appear to be hv ammo isn't worth the gp building on rocks makes for easy defense ladders really don't cost that much don't keep all your loot in one place keep up to date on glitches craft on the run have a ton of sleeping bags you can never have too many doors you can smelt/cook 4 items at a time don't plan your house too big salvaged tools are bad burst fire your gun deers come installed with vtec don't trust beancan grenades explosives can blow up the chests inside geared doesn't mean good or smart follow these tips and I'll still kill you )TL DR Best $20 I've ever spent.",

,Very Nice,
,EXCELLENT!,
,Probably my favourite game that I have at the moment. It takes a while to get used to making arial shots or saves but once you get the hang of it playing ranked is heaps of fun. Ranking up isn't to hard if you're playing with friends that also know how to play as repetitive wins faster ranking up.,
,"The singleplayer content is excellent. There's a reason after 2 years I find myself going back and spending hours there with no regret. The multiplayer doe? Just avoid itIf you want some of the multiplayer functions look for ""MP cars in SP"" mods. Trust me it's a shame they hidden a lot of cool weaponised vehicles (yes there are a lot of weaponised vehicles including another tank) and you can even summon bodyguards drivers and more. Basically you get 70% of the GTA online fun without hackers or rockstar mods or really any intervention.",

,"A lot of people are boo hooing BlueHole for 'breaking a promise' on microtransactions. They're entitled to their opinions but BlueHole's microtransactions don't affect anything. They give some flavor potential for those that want to spend some money on the potential for cool skins but you aren't forced to buy anything that would make you more efficient in game. To negatively review a game because you felt entitled to a ""microtransaction free environment"" is petty and childish. The addition of these transactions literally affects nothing at all. Another lot of people don't like third person. You should know up front that this game is 3P and that affects gameplay in a major way for people expecting to play it like a FPS. If you're in a house and concerned about someone peeking you use your ears position yourself intelligently listen for doors opening or footsteps. The game is amazingly fun and provides an incredible amount of entertainment. The devs are reasonably quick to fix issues. This is far and away the most I've ever played a pre release game and I have no intentions of dropping it from my play queue any time soon.",

,This game is good in its own way. There's some stuff that I really hate it's the loading screen when entering the multiplayer. You see I think I've spend more time in the loading than actually playing it and earn some money from the heist. But I like the game I played the hell out of it on XBOX 360. (I didn't get it on launch though I bought it when it was on sale.) The online experience may differ from one another.The key features that I want to talk about Story The Story is interesting. I love playing it there's this feeling that I get when playing it. The feeling is like when you first started playing a really awesome story based game and you want to know what's going to happen next. Also the illusion that's the game story is long and there's a lot to cover. It kind of have that feeling if you get what I mean. Gameplay I like the overall gameplay of this game but I kind of don't love that fact that there's a like a delay when using a controller for walking and looking around and stuff. I love driving cars around the Los Santos in both multiplayer and singleplayer. Online The online is amazing if you have friends to play with otherwise it's going to get boring at some point. But of course there'll be some people that really like the game can play alone and still enjoying it. I'm not that kind of a person. I love playing the game and all but you see I love co op. Of course you can find friends online and not just some of your mate that you know well. But I'm not really that great at talking with other people. There are some hacker that I've met and don't really care. I mean as long as it doesn't involved me it doesn't matter. A lot of people wants money and I do to but at the same time I don't even thoug I'm really poor in the game right now. I tried to do a lot of heist but there's too much of a problem because it's with strangers and it's better with friends. Performance When the game first came out it have a great performance already. I can totally run it at 60fps on almost maxed out with a Geforce GTX 780. But it gets even better when they're giving out more updates. I'll give this game 8.5/10That's just the number I just pulled out of my head. I will rekommend this game if you have friends to play with or you're type of a person that can totally play by themselves or really good at making friends online.,

,it is good for you,
,realy good game now is time to buy it for this great discount,
,This game is too much of a derivative of other games like Evolve and especially Friday the 13th. DBD is extremely confusing to newbies the tutorial is very good at explaining the basicis but everything else is lost to them. All the addons boostrers tributies whatever the unlockable or skills are make no sense. If you're in a game with an experianced player with these power ups you have zero chance of winning reguardless if you're the hunter or a survivor. It was intresting to play for free but.. just don't care for these asymmetrical games. I mean who's still playing Evolve anymore?,
,I bought 6 copies of this game from steam and 5 from GMG for family and friends to play with. Out of those 11 copies all work but 2 of them but its just my luck that the one of the two non working copies is the one I am using. I have tried every thing listed on all forums and support pages to fix my issue but nothing works an open ticket from rockstar in an attempt to fix the issue as well but still my issue is not fixed. I can play the game for random amounts of time before the game simply crashes on 2 of my computers and its the same symptoms on both machines. The game running with settings changed from extreamly low to as high as you can set them to test the issue and it crashes no matter what setting even safe mode crashes. I doubt that this issue is something to do with my equipment and I am finished jumping through hoops for support teams with all the uninstall reinstall disable enable rollback restore none of it works. I am convinced that this issue will be corrected with a patch and now I will simply wait until they decide to start looking deeper into the issue on thier end instead of looking at my msinfo file and trying to correct it on my PC. I have over 500 games and this is the first one to have this issue with its persistant crashing I have yet to trouble shoot any other game as much as I have this one and the biggest bummer for me is that when I do get to play this game for the brief amount of time in which my PC works with it the game plays and looks absolutly amazing I have no other game in my library that can touch it. I am hoping they can find a fix in an upcoming patch to fix my issues with this game so that I can enjoy it but until then I will just enjoy listening to my friends and family I purchased the game for enjoy it and focus on thier positive experience with it. I would trade my issues with any of the customers complaining about thier car missing or thier character wasnt tranfered correctly just so that I could play the game. after all those things being ed about are so small in comparison to the constant crashing issue. my specs just in case anyone reading this wants to know Operating System Windows 7 Professional 64 bit (6.1 Build 7601) Service Pack 1 (7601.win7sp1_gdr.150316 1654) Language English (Regional Setting English)System Manufacturer To Be Filled By O.E.M.

,This game has found legs and is the new kid on the block who showed off big. However unless they start adding and fixing some issues soon it will just look like a one hit wonder and loose the force they came in with.,
,Nothing better than the breeze on your balls while trying to gather resources and fight off players to build your own home and spend hours getting the best gear and weapons. Only for you to logoff and it be raided at 3am in the morning...Great game either way.,
,"Honestly not worth it. Just don't like the game. I liked H1Z1 (when it was good) and I even like Fortnite after playing it for a bit but PUBG just didn't get me. The specular lighting is completely exaggerated and the graphics overall rather hurt my eyes than look nice (and this is coming from a person that doesn't really care about good graphics.)Coming from csgo i literally have zero ""feeling of control"" in the game. Everything is like it's in slow motion. This is kind of hard to explain but people who play csgo will know that you can run strafe around bunnyhop etc. With pubg i can't even control my character while parachuting down the way i want to now this for example is not a problem with fortnite at all.FPS Just trash. Not much to say. My rig isn't the best with a GTX 970 MSI and an i7 6700k but it's also not that bad. Even when optimizing graphic settings putting things on low etc. my fps are still bad and the game looks even worse. Skillgap Well it's not really high. Again not to advertise or praise Fortnite but the building aspect gets the game to another level. Simply landing in buildings playing looting and running simulator isn't my understanding of fun. Did that enough in H1Z1.Overall this game is/was overhyped and it's honestly i can't even come up with a single positive thing about it. I've never really seen the point of playing Battle Royale games but i still had fun in h1z1 and fortnite. Not at all with PUBG though.",
,Very cool game principally because of the engine but graphics need to be optimized,
,Product received for free. Everyone crying about paid mods but i have like 80 mods and another 35 from the nexus mixed and matched into this game and it does'nt crach like OldRim......i haven't paid for a single mod and most of the people i see giving this a bad vote have barely even an hour played on the game _ its a good game get it simple as that bye.,
,Product received for free. its not bad,
,The game used to be super fun. Now the servers are extremely poor. I cannot even use full automatic on the guns as they simply will not want to shoot. In fact I have died more times in the past week due to server lag problems and hackers than I have anything else. Until these issues have been fixed I probably will not be playing much. The above issues ruin the experience and Bluehole seems to be completely ignore the problems at hand. When these issues are solved I will gladly change the negative review.*I came back and played after they have done some more updates. NA has been overrun with cheaters. I have been instantly headshot by people not even looking at me for the past 5 straight games. I would say that I get to play one cheater free game in approximately every 15 matches. It is that bad. This game has somehow gotten worse since my previous review. Please do not buy this game! Stay away from it at all cost! Maybe a region lock would help a little bit however that would not address the underlying issue. Their anti cheating system is a joke and people are walking all over it.*,

,Monster hunter is finally released to a new generation thats not a title on the handhelds? Seems like I've been waiting since the original to get back into Monster Hunter proper. So glad Monster Hunter World is that game. Reminds me of all the good times i use to have and I'm having a blast.The game had a more than rocky launch but it's a lot better now. Still those first few weeks hurt the game a lot i'm sure. Definitely recommend for anyone just looking now to get into it. It's been fixed quite a bit and is an awesome game!,
,The New Map Sucks BallsHitReg is worse then CS GO and that's saying something,
,Is a fun game to play with friends,
,they tell players all about there work and always keep you updated. and its a amasing game.,
,Great game. 10/10,
,If you look past all the modders and the bad economy gta 5 actually are a decent game. especially if you are playing online with a couple of friends.7/10,
,I have played this game for 200 hours and I can not say it has no bugs but from what I saw in the future update will be much more optimized and resolved from the bugs.,
,Great concept great game but the goddam cheating is ridiculous. Fix it!!,
,Great game have loads of fun on it and im not to bothered when i die either,
,Extremely unbalanced. Survivors are at a complete disadvantage. There are so many mechanics that give the killer the leading edge over survivors. Even new killers can win against experienced survivors and the perks for killers is completely unfair. A joke of a game and a joke of a developer.,
,gotta have a great pc,
,Product received for free. alright first of all let me say this game is a classic and one many rpg players or gamers in general will never forget me included but does this remaster live up to the hype? yes and noI cant really complain about wasting money because I got it for free alongside the other people with all the DLC i digress what i mean by no is the pc players specifically the modded players. I myself played around 430 hours of always 100+ mods and it was amazing i loved the game skyrim base and with mods the entire experience kicks off but any modded player will tell you skyrim just isnt as good without mods the graphics cant compare some followers e.g. Sofia are far superior and much more. And i completely agree I would never play skyrim vanilla vs skyrim modded if i had the choice. and its just the vanilla vs modded experience is heavily one sided on the mod side so theres no point instantly upgrading unless you yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods.but what i mean by yes is in about 2 3 months if enbs are supported and the modders of skyrim port their mods into the new game as many are already itll be faaaaaaaaar better because of bethesda fixing some bugs and the new 64bit engine and the scripts (although when it comes out you should 100% swap to skse se because its far far far superior and many mods require it e.g skyui) so when everything gets updated and ported it should be a far superior experience compared to 2011 skyrim.overall i most likely wont be playing the game for a while at least until skse or skyui somehow is supported for the new game. But when those mods are ported and availible for the game? ill be playing like its 2011 again im really excited for the remastered mods but a remaster of the actual game? didnt need it it wouldve been nicer to see a full new fresh remaster of oblivion or morrowind instead. so in conclusion theres no point instantly upgrading unless you yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods. However if you just want to play the game without mods go ahead and play its just a better skyrim for you but if you want mods youre gonna have to wait until skse se releases but when it does ill be playing it for sure alongside of many other people,
,It has come to the point where english speaking enemies are less dangerous than chinese speaking teammates,
,Nice,
,Terrible physics very hardware demanding camp rewarding extremally random game due to loot and zone spawns... literally this game has it all to make you angry. Not worth playing even if it would be free to play.,
,WARNING!!!! You will become addicted and angry in this game. It is by far the best survival game. It has everything min raft should of had. GUNS FORTS CLANS TURRETS. It is extremely difficult. I have only just gotten good and I have 350 hrs on it. If u don't want a game where u will die right when u are doing well this isn't ur game. Something to help is that u should never trust anyone NO MATTER WHAT. Kill them on sight! But also try to be hidden and make sure not everyone knows where u live. Good luck fellow survivor I'll see u on the beach.,
,its lags HEAPS /,
,In the current state of this game (Yes 1.0) I cannot reccomend this game at all. First off the Chinese players and subsequently the hackers from that region and Russia too are just ruining the experience. BlueHole needs to region lock servers. Seriously. Region lock Asia from accessing US servers. Secondly I take pride in overclocking my hardware which I can say PUBG does not like one bit. I've never had a game crash my PC as much as this one does. It's absolutely terrible when it happens. No I don't have defective hardware. Yes I've ran extended stability benchmarks with AIDA64 Prime95 and Superposition for 2 18 hours at a time and never overheat never crash and never have any problems with pushing hardware to its limits but when I play this game every single time my PC crashes. Fix your BlueHole. I'm seriously regretting this purchase but I do hope it gets better moving forward. I'll revise my review at a later date when the game has been built on more.,
,Fun!! Has a long away to go to be a complete game but it's in a good path,
,good,
,its a good game,
,Freaking sweet game worth the wait!,
,Garbage filled with closet cheaters and zergs.,
,I miss the early access times so much. The game was much better then. I'd rather go play Rainbow Six.,
,This game....is f***ing amazing D,
,Product received for free. game i got banned dont buy this,
,I've been waiting 8 years for another MHSo far still good...,
,Absolute bag of garbage with stupid devs who apparently don't know what a complete game is. Fix your janky settings or give a refund you absolute plebs.,
,They got Dacia.What is there more to say?,

,no,
,I only bought GTA V to play GTA Online with a fellow friend. I definitely haven't seen everything but so far I'm not that happy with this game. Here's why.Likes vast open world lots of toys guns vehicles to play with you can play it online with friends simulates (gangster) life more or less accuratelyDislikes long loading times inaccurate to aim with guns when using a mouse very time consuming. Don't buy this game unless you've got enough time to spend on one game. demanding on older hardware and thus sometimes laggy or not loading everything on time. can't buy online seperately from offline version of the game (I only want to play with friends not alone) consumes about 60 GB of memoryWho I would recommend to buying this game open world and modern gangster fans people with ENOUGH TIME. If not ask your friends if somebody has it and you could try it out for yourself.,
,New players dont even bother playing this... you WILL be wrecked.,
,hhhhhh,
,this game is aids. koreans suck at coding. irish ppl suck in general.,

,Fighting monsters feels fantastic. Hopefully they continue to add new beasts in the future,
,While I've had plenty of grips/issues with Rust over the years I would have a hard time not recommending this game. Even if the game were to turn to complete right now I'd still have to recommend it. I spent $20 on Rust and have gotten 1600+ hours of entertainment out of it you can't get much better than that.,
,真的很棒的一款游戏 和朋友们一起玩很好,
,If you like building a big base/home get offline for 2 hours then get back online only to see that you've been raided and lost everything then Rust is the game for you. But in all seriousness Rust needs work but if effort is put into it it will be worth my 20 dollars. As of now yes it is a fun game to play... with friends. Being alone in Rust is like being on a plane full of terrorists with nothing to defend yourself with. Yes I do recommend this game. Only because it has much potential and if you wait it will turn into a game worth waiting for.,
,I love Rocket League it so much fun and action is awesome. Sadly one thing I dont like is the crate system you have to spend real money to open them but it seem they giving a new item to help.,
,BEST GAME EVER.,
,Can you please not update the fckng game ???? u always it up... every ng time,
,I can kill hookers and strippers and inhumanly kill things 10/10 best game ever,
,Game got boring Same thing over and over. I really had an adrenaline rush everytime i got top 5 but now it is just a faint increase in bpm. The game doesn't have enough things going for it that others games like fortnite can't give you. The new map might be good might be terrible but I do not like the sand map so I am probably not gonna be playing at all.,
,Great game and if you enjoy battle royal kinda games it's definitevely worth your money.The developers seem active so more great stuff is to come,
,10/10 love killing people,
,One of the funniest games i have play. Perfect controls and extreamly funny to play with or without friends.,
,"Product received for free. Fun game but it's missing an proper comp system. Just like the ""big"" games have like League of Legends. Now its just a survivor rank that changes too many times in my opinion. And they should add a system were you get lobby's based on (the killers) level(s) for example it (could) happen that a killer is rank 1 (highest rank) and a new survivor joins the lobby at rank 20 (lowest rank) and it's his/her first game thats not fair by far the killer would have a huge advantage which can lead to new people rage quiting. (I know the stuggle)After all it's a great game and i definitly recommend buyer it!8.5/10 would juke the killer again.",
,"As with every GTA title to date It's been made to impress and does exactly that. The single player campaign is flawless and deserves an expansion since the characters were too funny and that'll be that. Beutiful graphics too 10/10 there no doubt about it and i'm not even running full spec settings!!! still looks amazing.But with all good things it must unfortunately come to an end.....If you are buying this game for it's online features I wouldn't recommend it to anyone despite all it's posh new stuff.There are multiple reasons for it too For starters the community is very much toxic and it's favourite word is ""noob"".....big suprise....people also like to trash you're vehicle repeatedly kill you for no apparent reason and then ofcourse there's the modders which is fair enough game has mods both SP and MP ones but the hackers/modders have found a way to spawn money ontop of you which sounds as pleasant as can be......then you'll get banned.....120% true stuff.But why so many hackers/modders? i'll tell you why too.It's because alike what happens with every ""Pay for just about everything"" franchise........it already has a cancer rotting and festering within' it...........They call this cancer.....SHARK CARDS!!!! A legal way for already rich millionaire dev's to fleece you for everything you got cause you like to drive cars that look cool and be one of life's ""big boys""......The hardline reality being that not everyone has this limited cache of real life money much alike everything is stupidly high priced to buy ordinarily on this game now. Even by grinding missions you're talking months to get and upgrade 1 vehicle because they made those a wreck too reducing actual rewards and then ramping up prices in game items.......So based on the fact that a lot of people don't have that endless time or money available what other choice do they have apart from to hack? ofcourse...........you guessed it!!!! &lt it's SHARK CARDS... 70 $150 of real life money (more than some average in a week pay).........for 8 million gta cash.........ummmmmm no.........that doesn't sound right.......cause paying that much and recieving that much might upgrade you a single car or 2 at the absolute maximum not taking into consideration all the other fabulous new features that are always just out of reach unless you can whip up plenty and lots of ker ching!!!!!So nope............pants nada..........not recommended.R* have messed this game up completely by over pricing everything it's just not worth it...",
,30$ HAHAHAHAHA I WILL NEVER BUY FOR 30% this game full bags HAHA,
,GOOD GAME,
,This game has more hackers in it than CS S had in its prime. Bluehole company says they're doing something about it but the proof is in the pudding. No thanks. I'm all PUBG'd out.,
,Matchmaking is so awful after a while. It's not wonder people get so many smurfs on this game. Unplayable after a while. Just look at my hours. Painful after the last 700,
,Take Two has really shot themselves in the knee here with the whole Open IV situation. This... this is not okay!,
,Mašina &lt 310000000000000/10000000000000,
,I really just like blowing up on here. The update is beautiful love the lighting effects.,
,its ok,
,Product received for free. hey why is no work for mE!,
,this game sucks fat nards,
,Chicken Dinner anyone?,
,Idk,
,Thanks to console peasants for beta testing 6/5 #pcmasterrace #kappa,
,PROS addictive tons of depth lots of different weapons types with unique playstyles multiplayer is fun bosses are challenging but rewarding crafting system is good graphics are nice mods are supportedCONS hitboxes can be buggy at times cant skip cutscenes dialogue can get annoying cant customize characters body (only face/hair),
,The ONLY reason I bothered wanting GTA V for the THIRD time on PC was for the mods and now TakeTwo is deciding to over the modding community!? This is a sad time in gaming history. I'm incredibly worried about the new Red Dead now. One of my favorite franchises is now being held hostage by a greedy corporation so that we can get what? A load of micro transactions shoved down our thoats? No if you haven't already DO NOT buy this game or support this corporate greed take a stand people!,
,I have been playing this game for over 20 hours and have experienced a certain number of issues and bugs. My main issue is that every time I drop into the game the map doesn't fully load and a lot of textures and buildings are missing. It takes about two minutes for the game map to load in and by that time other players have the opportunity to collect loot while I sit there and wait. It isn't just my game either other players have posted on forums that they have the same issue. I asked my friend who has played the game longer than I have and has told me many players have the same issue. He gave me a few methods to try and solve this issue but none of them has worked. I hope that this issue gets fixed but until then I am going to stop playing this game until I see more improvements.,
,hey now ur a rocc star,
,Amazing game to play but if you have a short temper I would not recommend this game for you. If you are lucky you can find some small servers with all friendly people who help out. But if not you're most likely to get stoned to death or shot to death. Very realistic it is like a revamped minecraft. My tips to you is that if you don't want to be killed don't kill other people to give them a reason to do the same.Edit 12/26/14After they released the new version of Rust it has gone downhill.Edit 2/22/15The new version is actually now becoming pretty damn good. A few more major updates and it might be as good as legacy.Edit 4/24/15The new version has gotten very fun. It still has some performance issues but changing the settings fixes that.Edit 11/28/16Just doing this to get a badge.Edit 3/3/18This game is trash.,
,The game litteraly crashes multiple times per game.,
,I didn't think I would like this game a lot but it turned out very very interesting despite being seemingly repetitive I find myself returning to it. What surprised me even more is that the nervousness never goes away even after 40 something hours I still feel nervous playing it as a survivor.,
,u hit a ball with a car10/10,
,As soon as I launched rust it tells me to tell you they're bad at their jobs on steam... whaaaAAaaaat,
,If your a weeb who has never seen a doodle this is the game for you you'll be chasing after many countless doodles thats blowing in the wind then realizing that there kids and not long after the cyber police are at your door and saying your under arrest for child pornography so you quickly reach for your gun and body pillow and squeeze but from playing this game for so long you dont have the strenght to pull the trigger far enough back and is too late and is taken under custedy.This is a true story of my friend Kakashi (steam profile) who has been a victim of this game and has been caught many times please put a end to this game so it can help his addiction Thank You.,
,Just doing this for the summer sale,
,It's really fun game for both side.In Survivor side we could get fun from horor escape matching skill.They also have to get the teamplay. (Sometimes not)In Killer side you can relieve the stress also you can show your inner cruel.Of course it's little bit hard game to people who can play less than 10games but after you got a skill and the rules and many situation you will proud of you that you bought this game.(In my view point blance isn't that bad cuz is up to Killer or map)Most important thing is this game isn't need that much of your computer spec that much.Also this game is less than 5GB. lol (Not sure about GB. Might be less than that)정말 재미있는 게임입니다. 생존자에서 하시던 살인마 역활을 하시던간에 즐거움을 느낄수 있습니다.생존자측에서 플레이 하실경우에 팀플레이와 공포를 느끼시며 게임을 즐기실수 있으며때때로 팀원을 버리는 과감한 선택이 필요하기도 합니다.살인마를 플레이 하실경우 물론 공포감은 없지만 생존자들을 줄여나갈때의 쾌감과 승리를 만끽할수 있는 좋은 게임입니다. 비슷한 게임으로 이볼브가 있지만 이볼브처럼 큰 용량을 필요료 하지도 않으며 속칭 '조선컴'에서도 돌어갈만한 괜찮은 게임입니다.,
,Really enjoy Rust. It's an open world post apocoliptic survival game full of surprises. 10/10 D,
,ing h1z1 clone,
,I have come back to this game time and time again and it still doesn't get old. I could play through it over and over again and still feel as immersed as i was when i first loaded it up after release. From the customization to all of the different storylines to the music. There isn't one thing I disliked about this game.,
,One of the best Space/Survival games i have ever played!,
,Shark cards r dum.,
,amazing game ruff around the edges. but you'll be fixed to the screen for days,
,I lai dis gam u shuld buy,
,Why doesn't this game have PS4 controller support? I want to see X Triangle square and circle. i thought this game was made for playstation as well you think it would have the option to use the controller. Other then that its an awesome game.,
,Yea.,
,funny,
,Rust is a great game that I have thoroughly enjoyed playing over the last three months since i have purchased it however there are some aspects of the game that are very irritating as well as some information on the store page that is quite misleading to say the least.Lets begin with the positives. The game is very fun to play particularly if you have another friend or two to play it with. The community is also not too bad not the worst or best that i have ever seen. However be careful of who you trust in this game cause not everyone is friendly but there is the odd few who you can trust and maybe join forces with. When you get started in this game there really is no limit to what you can do.The negatives that i have is the crappy optimisation of the game more specifically the fact that the game is plagued with a memory leak that eats up all of my 8gb ddr3 RAM making multitasking on my pc an impossibility so checking discord is a no can do unless of course you want to wait forever and risk crashing the game. This RAM issue is very common and leads me onto my second point which is the minimum system specs that facepunch has advertised for rust. More specifically the RAM requirement which states 8GB but not whether you should have DDR3 or 4. I can answer that question very easily it CANNOT RUN on 8GB DDR3 it has been a pain in the for me running this game and apart from chopping wood mining and crafting anything else is verging unplayable especially when there is such a heavy emphasis on combat in this game so you can't really play the game if every time somebody shoots you your game becomes a power point presentation. I can however run on 8GB DDR4 ram according to my friend so if you have that no problem however i would severely recommend upgrading your ram and/ or mobo (if cpu needs replacing).In conclusion i like this game it is really really fun (when it works) however i regret buying it without looking into it more or upgrading my specs beforehand and honestly i would like them to make the game more reliable especially for the money that you have to pay for it now.,
,Every time you get on the game gets even better because you are able to do new things like airials. After countless hours on the game and even after finishing all of the acheivements and grand champ being achieved this game has never seemed old to me. I recommend if both for casual and serious play. The community is great (with few exceptions) and new things are being added all the time. Both playing and trading up to that item that you wanted for so long has helped this game be able to pull off such a weird idea and make it into one of the top selling games.,
,buggy mess,
,Great game and one i have been looking for for a long time. love that you can play either slow or fased pased. I recomend this to everyone as playing in a 4 man team is a blast. This is what wildlands should have been like!,
,i am part of the omish mafia now,
,Product received for free. Same great game with nicer effects. Got a free upgrade. I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews.,
,i have ben baned for big donation i donated 1800 usd in gta online and week after i have ben baned rockstar unban me pls #rocstarunban,
,I cant llaunch the game i just bought it today and looked up quite a few vids nothing i did worked it just said running and nothing happened,
,Well..what can I say this game is a masterpiece i've only played for an hour but it didn't take me long to realise how amazing this game really is. It's like minecraft with mods...But better because it's realistic and it has amazing graphics (doesn't really bother me what graphics are like). I 100% reccommend this game because it's fun to play with friends and the overall gameplay is just amazing buy it if you wanna have fun. And of course it's only early access but i'm sure the future updates will make it even more amazing than it already is. 10/10 get this game 3,
,Great game,
,Its aight,

,As a fan of the series since Vice City I found the single player aspect a lot of fun. The lead characters are entertaining the detail of the world is incredible and the missions are generally great especially the big heists. However the online component of GTAV is simply a disaster. It seems obvious Rockstar is far more interested in getting people to buy Shark Cards and pay for premium vehicles bizarre clothing and weapon skins than making sure it's a well managed and competently crafted experience. I'm not against paying a little extra to customize a character's online appearance but you've got to put a reasonable amount of effort into making sure the core gameplay isn't broken before expecting myself and others to pony up extra which is obviously their expectation. My advice Next time don't bite off more than you can chew. Most of these troubles could have been avoided with better planning and putting some effort into maintaining a decent relationship with the player community. Here's a wacky idea Maybe release a single player game (with mod support) and online game (properly supervised) separately.,
,Game has big performance issues and many glitches. Even my friend with a high end PC has tons of issues. My game constantly freezes and buildings don't render in for the first 5 minutes making me unable to play the game for the most part. Even after multiple updates they still haven't addressed our issue. But they did come out with cosmetics so we can give them more of our money. Don't buy into this fraud another early access scam.,
,The single player is all kinds of fun but the multiplayer has been turned into a grindfest due to the greed of Take Two &amp Rockstar. If you have a patience of a saint and no real life job you might be able to grit your teeth and power on through to open up all the content but for most people with real world commitments you're going to have to buy shark cards if you want to experience all GTA Online has to offer. Everything has a cost. Want a fully upgraded car? That's an extra couple of hundred thousand. Want to grind missions? You'll burn through ammo and armour. Want access to the latest content? That's a cool 1.5 million ish to gain access to facitlities needed to launch it all.There's a reason Rockstar are now offering up a starter pack for 39.99...,
,The Campagne is the best part of Grand theft auto 5 its is very long and has allot to offer and on the Multiplayer side im not 100 percent pleased with it becuase it can get boring easy but I defently recomend having it in your steam libery XD,
,trASH GAME,
,This review took me almost 2 years to write and was delayed 3 times.,
,yeni şasi seçenekleri olsa daha iyi olurdu,
,Great game fun interactive multiplayer gameplay with good mix of fast paced action and stealth. Some salty plebs dislike this game because their broken builds got nerf but dont let that discourage you,
,Better now,

,Sh*test server ever. Too many hackers. Sh*t optimisation.,
,Got a rock bashed a guys head in took off pants 9/11 IGN,
,the reason I dont recommend this game is cause of multiplayer.The servers on this game have a great shot of winning a guinnes world record for worst servers in the history of worst servers.Literally EA servers are better than this crap.Also i was in a game where we all had green ping and yet the game was still atrociously laggy.,
,10/10 would heist again.,
,I only have 62 hours on this game and it has already become one of my most favorites.,
,Social Club is broke,
,sucks nuts,
,Don't buy this game you will get random ban and start your character from the very beginning after you play it for a long time.,
,Honestly I have nothing bad to say about this game. I've played it for a few extended play periods and I was impressed with how into it I got so quickly. Onny bad thing I have to say about it is that it's a little difficult to master the controls but that isn't too big of an issue.,
,This is a very challenging game but very fun to play. There is the beginnertime where you aren't that good at the game and might get annoyed quickly but once you get passed that it is an amazing experience every game again. Especially if you play it with friends.,
,BEWARE BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I can no longer play the game. Every match i get in it crashes. locks up my whole computer. I have to hard reboot every time i try to play. If a game can hijack your computer it should be deleted. This game is evil. cannot get game to play anymore.,
,grind fest10/10 v good gameonline is fun with friendsbut i have no friends (,
,Great game to just pick up and play.,
,Great game but Bluehole need to fix their servers. Start of the game it is like you have 500 ping and you physically cannot do anything. I'd say 50% of games I die to that early game lag.,
,Such a fun and addictive game I forgot to masturbate.,
,xd,
,Even though a lot of janky stuff happens in this game and high ping players riddle this game with issues its still an amazing game to play with friends!,
,Recommended Awesome Game!,
,This game is ing gay and im dong this for the badge.,
,The game is insanely great however the downturn too many hackers. It will be a good idea if developer able to eliminate them. Effort on updating game is appreciable. Can't wait for new map.,
,play it it is worth it,
,Only survival game I'll play,
,In a World where rockstar can make a game work on launch......this is not that world,
,TOO MANY NORMIES AND FIX YOUR GAME BLUEBALL,
,Take Two has ruined this game by effectively removing a large amount of mods,
,"The concept and the idea although not original it's well put in place tho' &gt Buggy UI from time to time&gt ""Network lag detected"" if it comes on (while in game) it will never come off you actually need to quit the match although you are connected and everything is un synch. This means losing your progress in the current match 10/10.&gt General performance is meh.ALSO &gt Promised bugfixes features and other updates &gt received microtranzactions! &gt bugfixes ""will be delayed next month"" yeah. sarcasm Obviously dev fixed all stuff regarding game performance UI features gameplay so addinng microtranzactions was the next final step /sarcasm ... not.Now dev's whining about someone ""stealing"" PUBG's concept which actually dates back to prehistoric age of gaming 10/10.Worst spent 30euros and 35h of my life uninstalled.Fix your",
,best game!,
,Grand Theft Auto is an awesome game don't get me wrong but the community is just dog Online for me is a huge no simply because of ers hacking and griefing. Offline however is fun and enjoyable. You can do whatever you want and install mods. If you want Gta V because of online only play with your friends and trusted ones.Conclusuion Get Gta when its on sale or go to Play online only with your friends and trusted ones. Have a beast pc that can run high settings.,
,我只想说 太多的外挂了官方请你着重的去解决这个好吗 这样让我嘛游戏体验度极差,
,Play with 4 friends all with bloody party streamers ing killer DC during loading screen lose all items ing great game,
,I've got a FX 6300.Yes it's possible. Having same issues with cities as everyone else.,
,Game is fun in general. Software needs a lot more optimisation. People that owns better computer have a lot more advantage since they can render everything quickly. Sometimes the game is buggy but it is a lot better than before. If you play in your own region latency is decent. I used to open crates but... since the introduction of keys crates became useless and are only to be sold on the market... The game is not pay to win but actually require skills.I personaly think the business model can be changed. Giving a thumb down because there is no average button. The game can still be improve by a huge margin.,
,Really nice and fun game to playI'll recommend it to anybody who likes to play good games,
,I've had every gta game since gta 3. This is the first time that I've seen a company publicly say screw you to the consumers. Everyone here bought the game for the same reason mods. If I wanted to play the boring story mode I would play this on my Xbox. Time to find a new game.,
,The game has come a long way. I can now say you get the game worth your money. There has been a lot of optimisation and netcode patches and the game has become stable. Still some room for improvement though.Gameplay wise the third map is on the way and weapons are more balanced than ever and a lot more attachments have been added.,
,Hackers and a gun game with guns spawning at rare chance,
,This is one of the best game I've played so far. The story mode is really entertaining and once you finish you can play online with friends or the online community. There are some cheaters on online mode though. You can own apartments houses discos yachts cars helicopters planes and a lot more. You can become a CEO and hire other players to make money and increase your power. I personally recommend the game because it's really well made and has almost no bugs.,
,fun game but it gets boring fast,
,Have 350 hours in legacy.I preferred legacy rust.Enough said,
,Pretty fun lots of grinding in online.,
,"The following review has been written during a very early early access.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a battle royale third/first person shooter with a semblance of realism behind it. 100 players enter through a plane and only one two or up to four can leave as a winner. That is honestly all you need to know about the game. There is next to no story and even if there is some backstory it is not needed to enjoy the game at all.Lets start with the good stuff The one map that is in the game is fairly large allowing probably even more than just 100 players to get lost in it. The sound system while glitchy is fairly good for a game of this theme. There are some problems but I will explain those in the cons section. Guns sound pretty well explosions are loud and generally the sound is just about right. Movement options are fairly great. Very reminiscent of ARMA 2. The game is really fun with friends. It has potential.Now the bad stuff Gunplay. While semi realistic most of the guns either feel like they lack any punch or they have way too much punch. From my experience there are numerous occasions of shooting someone several times (lets say 12 times with an AKM) and your opponent is still running around as if nothing really happened. And then you have weapons that touch you anywhere and you explode. Feels like the game would be better if it chose either strong weapons but a lot of cover or weak weapons with movement being the most important thing. Right now the weapon you find tends to dictate whether you are gonna have a good time or not. Not your skill. Map design. While I appreciate how large the map is there is a major problem with it. I hope you like to be sniped out of nowhere because that has been about 90% of all of my deaths in this. Players know which weapons need very little to kill you and since the maps are very elevated and scopes are fairly common most of the time you are gonna just shake your head and wish the game had a damage indicator. Shot recognition. While the sound design is generally great being able to tell where you are being shot from (and we are not talking about silencers) is almost impossible. Quite often the sound can be coming from one direction and you are actually being shot from behind. This has been proven by several video makers and streamers with some of the best headsets on the market. Lack of any tactics. Sniper is king in this game. The moment you find a weapon that can take a scope and the aforementioned scope you become the king of the game. This would be ok if you could in some way make sure you gain these. Usually it is entirely 100% random who gets these and if you do not find one in the first 5 6 minutes of the game you might as well disconnect cause that there is game over for you. There are no defensive measures in the game. No mines no traps. Not to mention even the sneakiest movement still makes so much noise that only a deaf person would be caught off guard by you. RNG. If I say that sniper is king in this game then RNG is the queen. The circles are 100% RNG. You may think you have jumped well gained some gear killed some people and then you notice that the circle has moved far away from you and the way towards it is bound to have at least 10 snipers waiting specifically for you. When it happens once you are miffed but its ok. When it happens ten times in a row you really feel like throwing the computer out of the window. Optimalization. As of writing this review the game is barely playable. There are people who can play the game just fine but majority of people with both bad and good RIGs are having trouble playing this game no matter the settings. Again even video makers and streamers with beasts for computers have reported major problems with optimalization. Lets not even mention constant crashes falling through scenery being blocked by invisible walls etc. Lag. As of writing this review majority of people are having major connection issues. Even people with legit really good broadband. For me for instance it is actually better to play on NA server... while I live in Central Europe. Rubber banding will be the death of thee at least a couple of times. Hit recognition is terrible because many times you unload 5 shotgun shots into someone and they kill you with a couple of pistol bullets because on their end you did not hit them and the servers ""decides"" who was right when it synchronizes. Hackers. Anyone willing to look into the darker corners of the Internet can see the market for the hacking tools for this game bearing major fruit. Why? Because it is an early access game that grew way too quickly for it s own good. Not to mention it is made in an engine that is by my knowledge very easy to hack into. It is sad and all we can hope for is that the developer will find a way how to deal with this menace. Right now it is almost more probable to find a hacker than to find a clean player. Rules. Anyone who puts ""These rules are neither final nor exhaustive we reserve the right to suspend disruptive users even if their behaviour doesn t fall under any of the above rules directly.""Is a fake person who just wants to power mongrel other people. Basically the devs are saying they can ban you for anything even nothing at all. Stay away.TL DRGame has a lot of potential if the developer decides to fix the major issues balance the game a little and add to it. It is currently in Early Access so it should not be a problem. I cannot recommend the game in it s state though I will continue playing it because even through all of it s problems it is a fun game with friends.",
,Good game,
,+ Satisfying level progression. Some fun gameplay elements (chases jukes). Really fun with friends. Toxic Community. Questionable gameplay mechanics (camping crutch perks). Devs that keeps changing their ideas for this game.At this price this game is worth it.,
,like,
,Solid game always fun dont understand the buthurt and the NPC outrage over this game,
,I am not recommending this game for one reason and one reason only Frequent disconnects from their servers. It is horrible. In the middle of fishing with friends? Disconnect.Fighting a wyvern with friends or randoms?Disconnect.Trying to matchmake because you have no friends?Disconnect.There is one thing that I have taken away from this and that is... Error Code 50382 MW1. Get this... Capcom has a fix for it... just go into your router and port foward I dunno.... about 20 different ing ports! Seriously? What's even better The fix doesn't even in work. You will still disconnect mid match or fail at matchmaking harder than you failed your 5th Grade Honors Calculus class. Other than the technical aspects of this game I'm having a blast however that is of course when I can actually play with my friends or the randoms I come across. There are some graphical pop in issues occasionally and the textures are too low res for PC but its all good and goes largely unnoticed during monster fights. If that is one of your gripes. If you aren't like me and are fine rolling solo then by all means buy it and play it to your hearts content.However if you are like me and care about playing with friends then hold off until they have a solid fix. Hope this helps.10 out of 10 wou... Error Code 50382 MW1,
,no,
,Very fun with friends,
,great fun,
,Excellent. So intense and so much fun. Still a bit buggy but developpers are working hard and the game is moving fast.First person is also now available that's great.,
,per game ever y e a,
,Worst port 2k18,
,Overall my experience has ranged from chill to heart racing cortisol pumping panic. Loot raw chicken breast from dead bears while you desperately search for just one more pile of wood.. always one more. Depending on the server you may have the island to yourself or be forced to face countless bandits as well as those that seem to simply watch the world burn although so far nothing can actually be set on fire aside from the one torch you spawn into the game with.It's still in Alpha so there are some rough edges which is to be expected. Even so it's a fantastic game IMO. 10/10 would buy again.,
,I have fun playing it.....,
,game,
,One of the best game of the 20th century. Go ahead if you are still not sure. But I highly recommend you to play with a controller (Xbox or DS4). Becareful of the community it's one of the most toxic I've seen so play with friends and you'll have lot of funs.,
,this game got for no mods,
,"Singleplayer is amazing. The story characters map. Even after playing over and over again it's still entertaining. I like it way more than the GTA 4's story.As for online this is the reason why I don't recommend the game because I think that most people nowadays buy the game mainly because of the online. Don't get me wrong I used to love it played over 400 hours of pure online everything was awesome I thought that this is the perfect multiplayer game they are constantly updating it and there is a lot of stuff which has become the problem. A year and a half ago everything was more or less balanced the prices were reasonable. After the Import/Export things were getting drastically different. Looked like this to me ""Hey buddy want to enjoy the content? Well you should get our brand new garage only for 2M.""Then Gunrunning. Again my overall feelings ""Look at this cool update! The players will be able to get their bunkers only for 1.5M. Also don't forget to upgrade your equipment for another 1M. Did we forget to mention that getting additional people working for you will only cost you half a million? By the way you will time from time get raided and lose everything unless you buy another cameras for 400K! All the raids will magically disappear! Want to modify your weapons in your Workshop? Well too bad you need a trailer for that but don't worry it's only 1 to 2 and a half millions. Do you want to train your shooting? There you go only for 700K! Do you prefer white over black? The paint costs 105K so... Did we mention that you can take a nap there? The key for that room costs 265K. Do you want a Gun Locker which you will probably never use? That will be 175K. You want some caddies? 85K or 120K if you want to have them larger. Don't forget to check out the new cars! Get yourself a car that shoots a couple of missiles only for 4 5M!""How I felt about Smuggler's Run Hello there! This update will be about planes. Want a hangar? 1 to 5M. Which style would you prefer? The one for 100k or the one for 320k? Want different lights? No problem the more expensive style you chose the more expensive lights you'll get! Isn't that cool? Want some nice 'art' on the floor? Sure we'll paint it for you costs only up to 200k just like your apartment you bought last year to do heists! Furniture? You mean another wall? That's another 280k for you. Again want the keys to access your bed? 235k 375k. You want to customize your 500k glider? One word WORKSHOP! And guess what this number 1 150 000 means... Correct! It's the price!""The prices of the content added were skyrocketing if you wanted to truly enjoy the game you had to either make money all day long if you wanted to be a fair dude that doesn't hack which is by the way another big problem with this game or buy some cards that are horribly overpriced. At this point I didn't have time to play all day long I didn't want to hack and I totally didn't want to spend twice the price of the game on some cards so I stopped playing. Since then I've been ignoring the game not watching any videos and not paying attention to the updates. Sometimes when I notice that there's an update I come back for a couple of minutes and look how a vehicle with a couple of missiles costs over 4 millions. Now another heist update you might think this ""Oh finally another heist things are getting back to the state when you could buy a house for 200k and get full content.""The reality however looks like this ""Hey it's nice to see you back in the game look at this brand new heist room only for 2 millions the same idea only way more expensive.""And as a person who doesn't have that much time to play anymore I can't enjoy the content anymore. Another problem with this game are the hackers. I finally am thrown into a lobby after 10 minutes of loading I see that I am immediately teleported to an airport from my house with a couple of other people and I am stuck doing some rather strange animations. I always report the guy when I find out who it is but it doesn't seem to help. I've heard some heartbreaking stories of people getting banned for no reason this luckily hasn't happened to me yet.",
,Pretty Good gets a bit repetetive after a while but good,
,i think that awesome,
,Fun with friends not so much alone,
,This game is not what I expected. The UI is clunky the combat feels stiff and trying to play with your friends is a nightmare. Not only that but after the 6 months that Capcom had to port this to PC the game is liable to crashes and some of the options are restricted (as per the other reviews). I can't recommend this game for it's sale price either wait until it's on sale or when most of the issues are fixed.,
,зайдешь лутше купить консоль,
,sh!t,
,Now you too can be part of the wild Dindu tribes!,
,I have 757 hours in this game and have stopped playing it and probably won t go back to it either why?1. Weapon change update completely destroyed the game what s the point of ARs? A UMP will destroy you at range with its non existent recoil even with no attachments. 2. Buggy lobby for some reason my friends couldn t see me online for months and I couldn t invite them to the group. This happened to a few us once again for months.3. The servers are laggy some games felt like you were 2 seconds behind everyone.4. Constant FPS drops and performance issues especially during event modes.Sadly I can see PUBG coming to an end even the more popular streamers are slowly moving onto other games. Anyways that s my two cents.,
,I cant reccomend this game after 140 hours the story mode is good but can get boring. In online mode there is way to many hackers and i dont think the devs do anything about it the only thing the've done is take away 7 million of my hard earned dollars for no reason which is stupid.,
,Product received for free. Everybody stop complaining about stuff you knew was true before you bought the game. Even though you probably got it for free. If you haven't bought skyrim buy this game it's amazing. There are just a bunch of salty kids who wanted bethesda to remake morrowind but that would've taken years to do.,
,new review no this isn't about stream snipingafter giving this a positive review in june I completely changed my opinion on this game and realized how ing boring it actually is after playing around 25/31 hours of this game trying to get ingame currency for steam market money. this is still better than h1z1 guns hit where you aim them but that's not why this game is boring as hell. item distribution is awful and if you want to play safe you basically get nothing and you're forced to drop into a city which if you're a new player you'll get killed in. trial and error right? maybe if you don't have anything else to do with your life cause AFTER you're out of a game you have to go through three loading screens a &lt short&gt queue another loading screen wait for people to load in wait for the plane to go above your preffered landing spot and fall. now the ingame UI is good but the menu looks and has animations that look like something made for a school project why don't the devs invest in making the game FASTER and better looking instead of adding new weapons that you never get to pick up or fog that barely shows up in any matches?June 2018 update bought the event pass and didn't receive an item from a challenge a week after completing it. support didn't reply yet. this game lost like 2.5 mil concurrent players it's not going to last by the end of the year and to anyone who wants to buy this knockoff fortnite battle pass DO NOT do it it's a SCAM and a WASTE OF MONEY,
,AWESOME GAME!,
,+ Optimization is very good+ Director mode is fun+ Gamepad support Requires a beast PC Online takes forever to loadThis game is legendary.10/10,

,"I have played for 500+hrs and maybe around 100+ on test server. I can say this is one of the best games ! Honestly 1.0! AMAZING! Hands down.Don't let the reviews scare you. This is my honest feeling about the game.Solo Can be challenging You either die within the first 30sec or you end up killing some poor soul that is trying to enjoy the game but you ended up gunning him down anyways. So you made it past the first 2 min gun shots are popping off near you. People do one or two things.. 1) Aggressive player Follows the gun shots and attemps to kill everyone around ( About 15% of the people who try this can do it) 2) House Keeping The guy that waits till gun shots stop and goes in to clean the guy looting .. (Enough said with that one) Now at this point you are either in the Zone or Driving/Running to the Zone.. Those Driving or running 50% end up getting shot and killed. The other 50% make it to the middle of the zone camp in a house or are out looking for kills.After flipping your car.. Running a guy down Gunning someone down.. you are in the Top 10 and either you get picked out by a sniper or fragged... RIP... Chicken Dinner !! You won your first game.. Congrats.. you got 1kill ... Duo You cannot go wrong with Duo's .. The amount of enjoyment in duo is legit over 9000!! You guys play together calling shots kill everyone the millitary base! Load out with Silence M4 lvl 3 gear Both got a Kar98 8x Silenced man! life is good! Bang bang! you guys killing it both got 9 kills each reaching the end of the zone! Chicken Dinner.. EZPZ if you got a good friend or team8 its legit amazing!! ORYall s*** and ... well you know you made it half way but didnt win.. Don't worry keep at it legit everyone can get a win... okay not everyone..Squad Where do you start man... its so fun! gun shots everywhere 4 squads landing at the same spot! granades flying Bullets Smokes Beating people down with your fist or a PAN!! amazing. You got that one guy on your team.. he doesnt know how to drive so gets all you killed!! Then you make it and there is people already camping the middle of the circle! your team rolls up and just get's LIT UP! no return.. lol.. OR you and your friends actually good and take them out! ... Either way you guys are going to have so much fun.. But sometimes you got that one guy in your team and you guys are on discord flaming each other ... lul ( We do this all the time) But legit fun!I have shot a guy mid air with a Kar98 while he was doing a flip on a bike.. I have also shot a guy inside the 5th seat aiming down the bridge (fkn bridge campers) with a K98 + 8x while car moving!Legit I flipped crashed into a tree blew up my 4man squad.. Had my Retardo team8 shot our team8 while he was down begging for help.. lmao.. ( After he killed him"" DUDE! i didnt know that was you!) Back flipping on a bike with your friend! Landing on a roof top! Done that! had a 8 man fist fight! its an experience ...Hacker's In all my hours on PUBG ( I only play NA) I have encounter i want to say 10 ? maybe less than 15 hackers.. I can't speak for all regions but NA I haven't seen a lot. Although.. its really annoying when you do get killed by one.This is my opinion on the game. I have had a lot of fun and a lot of games.. but you know it happens. I have gotten a lot better &amp I plan on enjoying the rest of the game. See you guys on 1.0 ! (sorry for my spelling mistakes I did see a few of them but honestly im sittinng here watching netflix at 1 30ish AM and I am not about to go back an correct them... Sorry lmao. I am lazy AF right now. ) Hope i helped at least 1 person if not then.. welph... Worth the try I love/hate the game.",
,Really impressed with this little program. The default wallpapers are nothing special but there are tons of free wallpapers available in the steam workshop. I have dual monitors and I can have seperate wallpapers on each. You can make playlists so the wallpapers cycle at timed intervals and a lot of the wallpapers can be customised with speed colours etc. Some wallpapers contain clocks and an audio triggered visualisation (one of these kept crashing my PC so be aware of that). Doesn't seem to use many resources even on high settings. The only downside is that using a 1440p monitor the content available is a little limited but over time more content should be available for this format. I found using 4k content or in some cases 1080p it looks good still. Well worth the price.,
,Product received for free. I didn't really look forward to Skyrim SE thought it was just gonna be Skyrim with some graphics mods but I was nicely surprised.It's way better optimized animations are a ton smoother and also it runs on 64 bits now so this allows for bigger mods and has better support for new rigs.,
,This Game Is Epic.,
,I wanna the ones who created this game... Just saying.69/10,
,Great game in the GTA franchise,
,I hate any company not allowing mods. Mods drastically increase their revenue and surely that is surpassing the few dollars that they lose from those 10 people buying their overpriced cash cards.,
,Game is amazing. Lots of fun. As far as the people complaining about lag spikes and fps drops. The game is still in EARLY ACCESS and the game is nowhere near complete. Yes they maybe adding crates and paid keys right now but these do not affect the gameplay. They are only cosmetic items and if they want to add them let them. Does not mean you need to buy into the keys. Microtransactions is just a way for a game to keep the servers up and the developing to continue on. I experience very few problems with lag or fps drops but I also have played many early access games and expect there to be problems until the game is fully released.,
,Great fun by yourself better with friends.,
,SSS,
,11/10 Has it's own porn gif creator.,
,good game,
,i got rocket league since it released i said that it was cleary a good game just need to clear from kids from the ranekd they just like little interferences.,
,Game is pretty good. Graphics sre good story is good with lots of possibilities. There is a minus tons of hackers tryhards in online. For me I'll vote 7/10,
,辣鸡服务器更新后进不去,
,meh,
,ooh Rockstar Xbox 360 bought GTA V.Xbox One another one.And there comes PC and another one.No regrets All love.,
,Very nice and addictive game,
,one of the best games I have ever played,
,This was a huge disappointment for me. I felt as if there was virtually no content. The interface and the ingame action felt glitched and it created almost no sense of immersion for me. I'm a huge fan of indie games though so I still wish the developers good luck.,
,My account was bannde for no reason!,
,"Just a few cars with nitro tunning playin' ""soccar"" how revolutionary!",
,"The premise of PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is similar to the hunger games. You parachute in from a plane before scavenging for supplies while constantly being pushed to a smaller and smaller zone by an incomming ""storm"". Game focuses on making things like map and weapons realistic unlike some other very *similar* game. While the graphics of this game are amazing I believe that many of the players don't get to experience it because of the crappy performance this game provides. While it will still run on medium specs pcs it a no for lower specs pcs beacuse this game bottlenecks literally everything. It's a multiplayer game with no story that gives you the freedom to approach your problem how you want or to solve an incomming problem that is comming straight at you. Only until recently there havent been any dlcs or a ranking system to this game. With that situation in the past it's weird how people stayed loyal and kept coming back to this game. Now there is a season pass available for purchase which gives you a ranking system and a way to unlock cosmetics. Free users get a change to unlock *SOME* of these rewards on *CERTAIN* levels of the pass with a great slowdown in progress of levels. Gameplay wise you get an option to choose between first person mode or perhaps a third person mode in which first person mode is still available. Gameplay includes standard long range fights or perhaps if you prefer something mid range or close range that is available as well. Game utilises the usage of vehicles to get around its huge and detailed map. All in all if you can ignore the problems of this game like some bugs and a medium amount of cheaters the game at the current price is worth also it's worth mentioning that the event pass is not expensive and it is easily affordable.",
,This game is Incredibly fun to play with friends. Its a game that is very difficult to survive. (Quite Difficult if Beginner). Yet its very easy to learn and pick up.Even if this game kinda repeats itself (If playing Surival) it just keeps getting fun by the minute.I havent really experienced all the gamemodes but i have played Survival ALOT and my max days is 28 getting there was so satisfying. And surviving Winter is truly difficult without a doubt.I can't really think about anything bad about the game. Some stuff i hate which isent really a bug or anything like that is you can get quite punished if you cut down trees as there might spawn a big Tree Guard which (Probably can't get killed).The only time I actually killed that Tree Guard was spending a whole day burning down Trees and kited the (Demi Boss) onto them so he started to go on fire but still even after i killed the boss it was quite impossible to survive the rest of the day.But the idea of the game is genius. The way the game looks is one of my favorite parts of this game.Even though i only played this game for a couple of hours and havent gotten to end game.I could undoubtedly say this game is my favorite game.Its easy for me to find a game i love but this game is above only ''loving'' this game.And i always bother my friends to play the game with me because of the sole reason of this game is outrageously amazing!My total rating might aswell be 10/10 but i think me giving it that would be stupid mainly because i havent even reached endgame or not even finishing a game but to be full out there only because i havent experienced the end game would make it a 8.5/10 but i think this game has a potential of 10/10 once ive experienced more of this truly fantastic game!Update I have been playing a bit of The Forge which is an event and ive not played a lot of it but I did spend around 3 hours on it non stop and all i can say is that its truly fantastic! Very fun as i said even though this game repeats itself its still fun. And that the game does kinda repeat itself on survival and in The Forge i personally think that that is the reason i love it but thats me personally.,
,After over 1500 hours I still have moments that are pure amazing. The skill ceiling is still getting broken so you always have room to improve. It's well worth the price and time to put in.,
,Great Game!,
,Great game only one problem. Everyone that I get teamed up with can never seem to hit the ball towards the enemy goal 3,
,Autism central,
,it is a good game i would give it a 8/10,
,10/10 would bang again,
,What an unoptimized piece of garbage.This is barely a functioning game and I don't think it being in early access justifies that.On top of that the devs have chosen to introduce micro transactions rather than optimizing movement and gunplay which in its current state is utterly f*cked.,
,Love this game One minute you're exploring a new land Then you're running for your life from a fire breathing Tyrannosaurus.,
,Well to start with i guess i was like alot of other people skeptical of soccer and rockets...After a few games i was hooked never playing normal socer again! If your on the fence because you dont usaly play sport games give this one a go never laughed so much at my teammates being blown to peices. ahahahaha,
,The overall game is really good but the gameplay itself is the main focus point.This game's gameplay carries the whole game by itself.,
,It's a good game. But I have to admit that the community is one of the most toxic communities ever! &lt /3,
,VERI GUD GAME OK,
,Please add 4 3 800x600 resolution! I have a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 that can run Dota 2 Insurgency CS GO and several other games but not this one due to the lowest res being in 16 9. Maybe one day I will be able to play!,
,Product received for free. Good game but devs need to listen more to players and work more on game than on skins,
,Its a great game but I just wanted to ask. How do you get the game to run better on a HP Laptop 8GB Ram 1T?,
,i just love playing this game . the feels different in each matchbut the the problem i face the most is buildibg rendering issue . itll take min 1 min to render the building .. no other game has this issue .. am not going to buy an ssd for a game,
,One of the best games i have played in a long time get this game with a few friends and you will have so much fun.The game does have server lag and poor optimization but the gameplay is on point i can not emphasis how good the gameplay is in this gameThey are working on the server lag and the lag i get is only because of havaing 8GB of ram having 16GB you should be good.I highly suggest buying this game,
,I BLOODY love this game. Sure it has its ups and downs but over all its fair and fun!(Sorry for the pun by the way),
,Minecraft with hatred for your fellow man driving you towards an innevitable and tumultuous eend butchered and recycled. PvP exstensive and hyper toxic community,
,Hell yes!,
,do you like getting killed all the time? do you want you re loot stolen constantly? then this is the game for you. where you work for hours and don t get anything done. unless you are playing with a friend and doing this to other people. then it is a fun salt mine ),
,I've only played MH4U on 3DS and while it was fun I did struggle quite a bit. But MHW is a lot easier allowing for new people to learn the game and have fun. I do thoroughly enjoy this game and I personally have no qualms with it. I do strongly recommend it if you've been looking to get in to MH this is the best way to wet your feet. I don't have the best hardware i5 4590 and a 2nd hand Fury X I can with a mix of med and high setting run 1440p at 60FPS and the load times are SO much faster than they are on console it's a joke. I have not had the issues plaguing others my internet disconnects are due to my powerline adapter but even then I rarely DC and it's never happened during multiplayer only solo. I hate paying $80 CAD for games as there is always other BS DLC to add on but with MHW I don't mind the price. In today's age where you need a season pass or other crap to get a full game MHW is a full fledged game with Capcom constantly pushing updates and events without asking for an extra penny. I strongly recommend MHW.,

,This game is great if you are a beginer at survival games. Its easy and not so hard to get into. The only thing i want in this game is that people like me can host a private server were you can play with your friends without being afraid of other players with better gear.,
,Good game but bad service I always get killed in game in the last minute other players always pre fire and knowing where I hide. That is cheating.Good game but bad experience. I'll play if cheating is prohibited. NOT recommend.,
,Great game. Crafting system is intuitive. Progression is excellent. Only thing I wish it had was a single player option. Public servers are a pain because of the people. Worst part about this game is the community. If you build a base in a public server you better expect it to be looted and/or destroyed when you come back to the game.If you like pvp (and many do) then there are tons of massively popular pvp servers. But if you want to survive you better have a group of friends also playing. Or at the very least join a group already established on the server. Trying to go alone is guaranteed suicide.,
,Good game,
,I SERIOUSLY DON'T LIKE THIS GAME SINCE THE BIG UPDATE AND THE NEW MAP ( YOU RUINED IT... YOU HAVE TO MAKE US ABLE TO CHOOSE WHICH MAP WE WANT TO PLAY!,
,THIS GAME ITZ GOOD BUT WHEN I PLAY 1 MINUTE IT SHOWSME A ERROR AND THEY KICKED ME OUT,

,Awesome game if your PC can run it that is. Tons of action. It reminds me a lot of DayZ with the boring running sim taken out.,
,Very good game... Just its hard to play solo but its funny,
,good game,
,Not a single clue what you guys did with this recent update. The game officially has aids....,
,plain and simple t. Bullets always miss even when you have no ping or fps problems you always seem to lose the gun fights or fire a shotgun round into someones face/chest when they have no armor and they just shrug it off like your firing at their faces. total t.I still play it besides all the that happens e_e,

,The online session is totally trash I didn't play GTA online for a long time and finally bought this game during the winter sales but when I connect to online session the game told me my online account has been banned permanently. I'm like what the is this ???!!! I spent 4hrs to download this game with full excitement to see what's new in the GTA online and BOOM! Full of dissapointments. All of my hardwork in GTA online BOOM gone just like that and there's no point for me to grind again for another 300++ hrs to achieve back what I achieved before. Save your money on other games don't buy this piece of (P.S I bought physical copy before this),
,I have waited since this game came out on Xbox to play it. I watched videos to slate my thirst I read some reviews on it. But when it came out for PC I didn't want to drop $60 on it. Then I remembered how long I had waited for it and said screw it. It's been almost 2 fricken years but I finally got it and it has absolutely blown me away. None of the problems that GTA IV's PC port had. Only sweet lovely BEAUTIFUL perfection. If I didn't have to do work around my house I'd be on this all day.Get it.,

,Great game but..Duenevo (I think that's how it's spelled) chops fps in half and hurts paying customers.If you alt+tab it crashes.Multiplayer servers crash 1/3rd of the time.When servers are working you must all complete parts of the mission solo since everyone hasn't seen a pointless cutscene?Mouse acceleration and no FOV slider Hope they get to fixing these issues cause the base gameplay is spot on.,

,Was killed by a car that didnt make any noise. Game requires map variety. Most players go to the same spot (school military base prison etc.). Players who drop on less contested areas tend to camp out till the end.Network LagCrouch jumping is essential but is extremely difficult to do especially for new players.Hit registration sometimes comes quite late sometimes. So if you are hit a few times without getting any health deductions you can make it to cover only to see you health bar go down suddenly and die.,

,"so this is a triple A?no optimized pc controls seems to be pretty much the cheap standard today.its pretty much unplayable with mouse + keyboardswitching through items while using a bow for example is unbearable.and u just might say here well there are lots of other perfectly fine weapons to use!that might be the case but its a matter of principle in this case.if that wasnt enough there is a useless ""intro phase"" at the beginning that just seems to be there for the sole purpose of locking u out of the main game for aprox. 2 h so that u cant refund it anymore.its not as grindy as i feared but 15 mins time limit on missions is a trigger factor... whats the purpose?coupled with the fact that the glowflies dont always work perfectly you can imagine the frustration when you finally confronted a beast in its lair and almost killed it just to get the ""time's up"" message.... close but no cigar for u sir!you might have fun with friends if they had any incentive to play with you in lower tiers.all in all its not very beginner friendly and in a negative way. i just dont have the time anymore to watch a dozen youtube clips to become better. if you are invested and have the time this might be actually perfect for you. just wasnt for meand goddamn whats wrong with good pc controls? its not that hard. others can do it. and their game isnt 60 bucks + multiplatform(equals more revenue)just look at dauntless. not as much content as MHW im sure but the controls are very good.and its free2play. so i guess it CAN be donenowadays all this is just a red flag for me...",

,"First you have a cheating problem which is just part of the Chinese problem. I don't mind playing with Chinese players but they cheat and they treat the game badly. They are loud and obnoxious in the waiting area and on the plane so much so that I have to totally disable voice communication. The cheating is obvious why not pay money and use a better anti cheating system I rarely see cheaters in BFBC2 and I played that for a while but we had to use Punk Buster. I understand that Chinese players are what gives you numbers but you aren't going to increase numbers this way you have already saturdated the Chinese market and other markets aren't going to jump onboard if all they hear is yelling followed by being shot in the head from the other side of the map in 2/3 games. I have had good games with some Chinese guys and I don't mind the loud obnoxious open voice thing but i can't stand the cheating. Somtimes I feel like grabbing a microphone and yelling ""China #2 Taiwan #1"" but I don't mainly because i think half of them would turn their cheats on. Also your shooting mechanics seem to be broken half the time.",
,With the new release I can safely say this game is F U N. The First person aspect of the game feels loads better and there's significantly less rubberbanding and desyncs. The game looks great at lower graphical settings without being as taxing as it initially was during early access. The game used to take 90% of my processing power but now it runs at a nice 20% and 40% GPU. Good stuff!,
,game sucks I cant run it on the lowest settings. dont even have a bad computer. go yourself blue hole.,

THE LOADING SCREEN IS BROKEN THE MAIN MENU IS BROKEN THE MATCHMAKING IS BROKEN HALF THE BUTTONS DONT EVEN LET YOU CLICK THEM!! THE NETWORKING IS BROKEN BEYOND ANYTHING THE FPS IS BROKEN ASF! I know it's in early access but that is no excuse to sell people such a disgustingly broken piece of money grabbing game IF you can call it a game.And do not say that I don't know what I'm talking about because I have 0.6hrs. I have 100hrs+ on a different account playing it now and then when they say the have ""fixed bugs"" which we all know is not true.Although this 'game' is terrible is still MAYBE just f****** might have a slight bit of potential left. IF the developers get their together.PROS If you like to stress the f*** out and rage until you pull your hair out pick this game up it'll be perfect for you!CONS BROKEN BROKEN BROKEN BROKEN BROKEN. Fix your f****** game.Not worth $30 what so ever.Bye have a great time.",
,ing nice game.,
,Great game to play with friends and test your skills. Although this game sucks because there is no Anti Cheat system which results in most games and deaths by cheaters...,
,Very Good Game Takes some time to complete a match sometmes a full hour it depends how good you are. I hope there will be a better store sytem in the Future.,
,Product received for free. Nice game wiht friends on online but litlebit boring alone...,
,This is by Far the Best Video Game I've purchased!It's so good that I can't stop loving it! The only Cons I want to mention is that Lack of Team work if do don't have Pro Friends to Play with! Everything is just fantastic! I spent 23 USD on this game on sale with 3.5 Million Cash in game cards which was tottally worth buying! Fantastic Game/ ignore the Trolls! they're everywhere! Add me if you want!,

,Take Two is a scummy business. I hate it when corporate greed shuts down something good. Meanwhile millions are cheating ONLINE in your games (which you do NOTHING about) and you can't handle people modding a singleplayer portion? Are you kidding me? RIP Rockstar.,
,Really great game after the 1.0 update. Servers are much better the maps are well designed guns are balanced the graphics as good as always and the performance is really improved now. There might be a few hackers here and there but just give the game some time it just left Early Acces so it has time to get better and better. I have high expectations from this game and I wish they are going to become true soon. After all its totally worth it.. EDIT1 game dont buy waste of money... EDIT2 Still pretty good game and enjoyable mostly with friends EDIT3 Broken game not worth it rn EDIT4 Game don't even bother spending a penny on it. EDIT5 New update live implemeting a new map and a SEASON PASS... Even less reasons to play this game anymore.,
,They just killed half the game community. gg T2,
,Endless hours of pleasure,
,please fix the 'app already running',
,If you like the Harvest Moon series you will love this.It has a lot of the feeling of the original series with a few other additions that make it unique.Amazing game the ratings speak for itself.,
,Completly amazing game i strongly recommend it especially if it is on sale!,

,AAAAAAAA+++++++++++++++++++++++++,
,It's the Hallmark holiday special of video games.,
,Its fun. sort of silly sometimes. Gives you a rush like the old arcade games way back. Worth it.,
,A difficult and often frustrating game... but when you get that squad wipe or insane moment it all becomes worth it ). The final circles in the top ten are so intense and fun! Amazing game! Be prepared to lose A LOT lol.,
,good game i like,
,great game but be prepaired for the most toxic player base you have ever seen! every game consists of one conceeded goal followed by a tyrade of troll vomit lol i thought COD had a salty crowd i knew nothing!,
,fifa with cars and no refereelag/10 would spontaneously teleport halfway across stadium again,
,ing amazing game buy it now!,
,Okay so... i played the story mode very nice played online literally cheaters everywhere got 1b money drop within the couple hundred hours i played and get a warning for having too much money get it taken away (im not mad this happened its just fair play i shouldnt have 1b for anyreason). i decide to try modding for fun literally the first hour just make my car fly and change colors with 3 of my friends get instantly perma banned like wtf. and i cant appeal because a bunch of dumb kids on youtube make videos saying just lie to get unbanned so then rockstar changes to policy to all bans are final and i got banned before the policy change and cant play online i kinda wanna play again just for fun and drive cool cars. i got banned like 2 years ago and wish i never modded i could still be playing this game it was fun too bad rockstar doesnt care to let me appeal a ban for doing literally nothing that hurt that game.,
,fix server ples capacom,
,The strategy that you have to use in order to win! Love it!,
,this is gr8,
,Fun engaging and challenging!,
,Game got old and community is too cancerous. Probably should only be played for drunken split screen fun. Other than that stay away.,
,Good campaign and fun online,
,Ok it's officially unplayable I've been killed by people who were clearly hacking 5 games in a row. Also the circle is annoying and cancerous,
,Easily one of the best multiplayer games ever made. I find myself coming back to this game more often then I realized. They could easily do a Tron Light Cycle Mod for this game which would be super cool as well. Or even Disc of Tron like that old stand up arcade game. Which was bad !! Anyways this game rocks plan and simple...,
,Much speedier than the PS4 version other than that I m not seeing any differences but those small comparisons people love so much I don t notice really.Was a great game one of the best Grand Theft Autos so far with an online multiplayer with endless upcoming content. 10/10,
,REGIONLOCK. Hackers can SMD. And Crashing out of the game without being able to rejoin can also SMD. Edited on 2/21/18 It can still SMD,
,can even hunt a monster with friends connection is just sucks never last more then 5 minutes dont waste your money on this stupid game,
,good joke game to play with friendsi cant recommend it for 28 whatsoever (compared to the free alternatives)if you're into the combat in arma and a slower more tactical based battle royale then by all means get this game.Personally though im not a great fan of the slower pace of this game. Everyone ive encountered has shot me from somewhere i cannot see them (leaning behind a tree or hiding in grass using a suppressed weapon) and nearly all my kills are from me hiding in tall grass or in a bush waiting for an unsuspecting player to walk by.im also not a massive fan of the cosmetics system in this game either. I feel at the start everyone looks very similar and once you save up your hard earned bp you end up getting a crate you need a key to open. the basic loot inside these crates i dont exactly like and the neato looking cosmetics are all rare and so have a high value. After they removed the clothing spawns ingame ive never been able to find any neat cosmetics when searching a house (i love the trenchcoat haha) and i dont see why they've done this. Sure it increases normal loot spawns but they can make them seperate and so you find weapons with the clothing.in my last few matches i havent really encountered any noticable bugs. which is a great improvement from when i used to play. The game used to be horrible to play bad fps loads of bugs and the graphics looked like doo doo. However i don't know if anyone else finds that its different for them.Anyhow its a fun lil game. best played with friends. however id wait untill this game goes on sale (if i ever does cos i dont think ive ever seen it on sale),
,I would say that there no hack.,
,Product received for free. DA,
,i just got banned from gta online for being afk for 10 min. yes BANNED for 30 days. what the is that t.,
,This game is great. A great premise and a great format. There are a few issues but some of them are just inherent to the game itself.1. You're first couple rounds of survivor are actually pretty scary. After about match 10 it just becomes a game a great game but no longer heart pounding scary. So if you have a family member you want to scare the crap out of the investment is well worth it.2. Balance will always be tricky to get just right. The Devs have consistently listened to the community and added great things to the game and adjusted the worst parts. People will complain about Decisive strike and dead hard all day but I still remember when you didn't have any hooks on the map! Good luck killing anyone like that!3. Hook camping is a fun sapper. Since the games inception camping hooks is the biggest complaint I ever had. There really isn't anything the survivors can do about it except keep doing objectives but that makes the gameplay completely boring for the person who got hooked and the killer is actually missing out on tons of BP but they never listen.So I highly recommend this game for everyone except those who are squimish about blood and gore.,
,A bit boring when ur done with the offline story,
,+,
,addictive simple really fun physics are well done long overdue game idea executed nicely,
,Great Game just wish online was more stable,
,I love the idea of this game. Love the desperate feel and the adrenaline. But glitchy?! Oh yes. So so glitchy which takes almost everything away from it. I recommend it only with the hope that there will be fixes in the future.,
,Excellent game if you play FPP at least,
,)),
,I love the game but its laggy af. I have a GTX 1015 TI graphics card and when i play on the lowest settings in game it cant go above 30 fps and it crashes sometimes.Only play this game if you have a very good computer.sometimes its playable when a server is empty and its ping is lower than 50 i recommend this game for high peformance computers.,
,noice,
,Awesome game,
,Awesome game 10/10 Recommend to buy it.. ITS AWESOME!,

,GREAT GAME GO BUY IT. LIKE RIGHT NOW SERIOUSLY ANYONE WHO BUYS THIS GAME WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH IT!,
,Hi I'm the worst RL player in the universe. But I still swear that this game is really fun somehow.,

,A blast and a half. Go killer when starting to get used to maps and game.,
,If you continue to upload many more expensive items that nobody needs instead of fixing your game.PUBG will remain forever a dead game,
,Amazing game in more people,
,holly funny .It's very difficult but very funny,
,I have heard a lot about this game. I really want to play it but it will not load me into ANY servers. I am about ready to give up on it. All I want to do is play it and I can't even load into it to try it. Any advise from anyone???,
,Played GTA V lost touch with reality.Played GTA Online lost faith in humanity.,
,I have beaten this game at least three times on my ps4 now I'm looking to beat it many times on this pc! Highly recommend there is always something to do in GTA V no matter how many times you beat it. At times missions are not very similiar as they have thier own kick to each one. which keeps you on your toes. 8/10,
,Best Loading Screen SimulatorBest Getting Killed By Other Players Cause Why Not Simulator,
,Awesome game. Easy to pick up and start but difficult to master. There's always something new to learn.Great thing about it is you can play it in short bursts and you can have fun even if you are loosing (at least I can).Competitive mode is great and queue times are short. Great game and a lot of fun.It's better with a friend (IMO) but you can play it alone and have a lot of fun.Buy this game! You won't regret it.,
,by far one of the greatest games in terms of fun and competition and should be a game on everyone's xmas list,
,THIS GAME INNGGGG SUUUCCCCCCCCKKKKKSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
,Really good game it's not a game you would play 24/7 It's a game you play when you are bored.,
,Hackers aren't as freaquent as most say found at least 2 hackers in the 250 or so hours I put into this game. 10/10 would recommend Ign,
,Game is full of Hackers. Dont buy it unless your into that sort of thing.,
,Game that looks simple when buying but proves to become a game of solid thought for newer players to manoeuvre their way through these maps. Enjoyable team game for those who play in the survivor role and a solid solo game for those wanting to kill online randoms. Good graphics and gameplay with little bugs would recommend to try this game out for the adrenaline that comes with it. Great fun ),
,Wanted to just send the developers a quick message but there is no easy way to do that. Love the game. But i really like it when my internet studders for a minute then the game kicks me out for 15 minutes. Thanks Rocket League great job,
,nice game,
,If you love cars murder and Los Angules. THIS game IS for you my friends. Welcome to an experence of joy from murdering your friends online or if you want to... Play Missions offline. There is so much to do in GTA V. I... Recommend this game!!! To you guys! ENJOOOOOOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,

,This is the one game I keep coming back to.Guess you can call this game my dirty pleasure.,
,Product received for free. good,
,This game is my worst steam purchase and worst purchase in last 5 years. Too many bugs in the game. And I am being killed in every other game by impossible shots. Hacking is a big issue in this game and I don't think PUBG will ever be free of hackers who take all the joy out of the game,
,First GTA game i've ever play was not dissapointed at all. This game is extremely fun.,
,6/5,
,I have proven that you can play this game on a rather pc. Very well optimized.,
,yes,
,Just bad,
,starts a fire. its litu got it? xdddddddddd,
,Changed Thumbs down to thumbs up. Servers improved significatnly. Although theres some bugs here and there but its def gotten lot better.,
,I've mostly played online which is fun. I've noticed playing with friends is way more fun but the pubs seem decent enough. The story I'm saving for another time but is very fun to play to where I got. Worth full price? I don't think it is now the hype died down a little. Multiplayer had a severe hacking problem and at this point seems very lackluster for the price. Payday 2 is a much better heist game.,
,IF MY GAME CRASHES ONE MORE TIME I WILL LOSE MY GODDAMN MIND!!!,

,Very good game with some extra stuff like being penetrated by a pan &lt 3,
,Fun untill you get shot in the head from no where then your off until your in a game again looting then you do it all over again,
,Practically pay to play wish they'd allow mods.,
,Nice horror game. worth 10 bucks on sale.,
,It's OK.,
,uhhhhhhh...,
,Fortnite but for people with money,
,This game is full of hackers. Everywhere. There hasnt been any game development since they released the early access. The Developers got their cash grab and completely abandoned the game. While it IS fun when you have a private server you rent it becomes a 24/7 babysitting job to keep all the kids Russians and 3rd world hackers from destroying everything while you are not on the server..... It has the most hackers of any game I have ever seen and the Devs do not seem to care.,
,"We Spawned. We were naked. We had rocks torches and nowhere to go. me and my friend sprinted off into the distance flapping in the wind as we ran looking for hemp wood and a place to call home. After being on the run gathering resources for a few hours we decided to pitch up tent next to a rock. We had sleeping bags and after 3 hours of flapping about finally made some trousers and hid our manhood from one another. The next couple of hours took a turn for the worst. someone was knocking at the door...one man slamming our (wrongly placed) backwards door down screaming some hateful words of death through the keyhole. I looked at my half nude friend...surely our time is up? surely we are done for? We built a home here We slept here even made our first pair of pants together here...all for this our sure demise.Wait gunshots...and the agonising scream of a man. Then the door flies off and enter two men that had saved our lives.""hello kind sirs"" i say ""hello"" they reply""you have saved us we owe you our life!""after this we decided to travel with our new friends and watch them slaughter half the server with weapons we could only dream of having smashing down doors killing nude men. I couldnt help to think that only 4 hours ago i was one of those nude men just looking for a place to call home and some pants.Our story ends here still on the run still half naked and still yet to find someone other than the two heros of the story that dont want to blow our heads off.7/10 would buy again.",

,I highly recommend this game for the story mode. Its insanely fun and beautifully done. One of the best games ever.As far as online I have spent plenty of hours online and it has given me so much entertainment. The thing is this issue with modding software. It happens way too often where you are in a server and someone is modding and causing problems. There is nothing you can do but report the suspected person or join a new lobby. This is highly frustrating that we have to deal with it on a daily basis in almost every server. Not very fun to lose a big sale because 6 random vehicles spawned on top over you and everyone in the server. This has RUINED the online experience!!!!Story mode is amazing and definitely worth playing worth the money. Online is very good if you can tolerate the modding that happens. Or the kids begging for free money. These are huge negatives for me in the online and I just returned with the new DLC after a long break. I recommend this game now for the beauty and story but I warn you the online experience will vary and you will likely find yourself jumping servers frequently to avoid modding and griefing. Grow up kids!,
,Very naise i luv pigs n diamond swords n also respecting wamen,
,Fast Tactical Gameplay with your buds or solo......cant beat it!!,
,Pretty Good But It Needs To Be Optimized,
,Bedt game that come too live this car are real believe me i saw it they played football outside of my house,

,THIS GAME IS SOOO GOOD THAT EVEN DEADPOOL HIMSELF PUTS IT ABOVE CHIMI F*CKING CHANGAS!10/10,
,Rocket League is team based game where you play football with cars. You can run it pretty much on every computer thesedays. You have also ranks and tons of different modes. I like this game and i can recommend it to everyone. Like it!,

,I en love chode ur game is so much fun!,
,no other game makes your heart beat as fast as this one will when you win a chicken dinner.,
,Product received for free. Very good game I would suggest this to any kind of gamer. But what would be better is that crates are easier to get and that you dont have to buy keys to open them.,
,Fun,
,This game is just amazing! The story mode is interesting and cool and the online mod is very funny and there is a lot of things to do!,
,First bought this game as the Collectors Edition on xbox 360 was quite fun.Played it on PC a year and a half later and it seems like a completely new game.Graphics are awesome and the optimization is pretty much perfect. Running at 60fps+ is a dream in this game. Worth the wait! 9/10,
,Great game very reccomended,
,Best Battle Royale game out there.,
,I had a job and friends once.... Then this game came out..... So much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
,Fix your game....,
,This game is a laggy mess. It is poorly optamized and crashes on any pc. How far you can go depends on how much ram you have. I had more fun playing with a pile of $h1t. It wazs fun at first but as the updates rolled out it became worse and worse. right now the game is also taking weeks to release the patch killing my hype. Let me know if anyone has similar issues.,
,Very addictive and fun game. Hopefully they get rid of the lootboxes in the game because that's the only complaint I have about it.,
,good game,
,+,
,Overwhelmingly Negative,
,I'll be blunti have spent a lot of time in this game and it is very addictive however there are many things that need fixing although i have found myself immersed in the gameplay as both killer and survivor so for the amount of money i spent it was definitley worth it so it deserves a positive rating,
,Horribly optimized game and will probably never be done another money crate game. With garbage hitreg,
,Tense games that are great with friends. Even playing solo is a blast but it doesn't compare if you can get a few friends together.,
,垃圾 游戏,

I want to watch them squeal... I am a killer its what I do... and you get called noob for that ?

,Product received for free. In short vanilla Skyrim Legendary Edition with a lighting mod and a water mod. Textures are still bad can't change volume in game in fullscreen mode still capped at 60 fps by default and I still feel like there's a 50% chance alt tab will crash my game. The only redeeming quality is that it's 64 bit so mods have more room to work with.,
,Great Game,
,Product received for free. Nothing to do no items spawning anywhere no objective no fun.

,A great game windows 98 runs perfect on this. 10/10 optimization.,
,Basically pay to do anything new as in spend 1000 hours grinding or buy money rock just wants dollar.,
,Very well made and lots of fun and very stressful. In early release so of course there are several bugs and glitches here and there but for the most part it plays really well.,
,One of the best GTA games.,
,Awesome and addictive. If you enjoy survival games this game has it all. Highly Recommended!,
,Astroneer is a terrifically fun game and I really hope the developer continues to produce quality updates for it. It has more content in it as a 'pre alpha' than a lot of early access and beta games that I've played in the past and it's ludicrously simple and fun.Yes there are some issues like crashing (primarily if you're playing multiplayer single player is very stable) and some wonky bugs like very rarely falling through the world when you get out of vehicles. And there's a finite amount of content in the game although there's enough IMO to justify its $20 price tag. There are also some basic features that you'll find in many games like a save management system that just aren't here.But the environments are gorgeous the play mechanics are intuitive and enjoyable (I especially like the fact that there's no UI it really helps with the immersion factor) and the graphics and animations are styilized but fun and beautiful. The fact that there are already multiple planets available (albeit with similar threats and resources available) is great for a game this early in its development.This honestly is what I think No Man's Sky intended to be on a smaller scale but with the potential to achieve what NMS probably won't. If you're into exploration/crafting/survival games I highly recommend picking it up to help out the developers to build this game into something amazing.,

,Angry *aarghh*!,
,The game is a ton of fun. HOWEVER it's going in the wrong direction.Pay $20 &gt has cars as dlc &gt lootboxes keys you need to pay for &gt rocket pass locked behind grind &gt get a premium! Buy it.Haha for $20 you still don't get everything.,
,"This game is pretty neat as long as you have your lucky day and play with friends.This game is not so damn good if you keep having desync getting shot through ground getting camped like in CoD or getting random crashes.Unfortunately at least one of the former happens at least eight out of 10 games.Just wait for them to release a proper version and not follow the people who release ""beta"" game. What the is wrong with this industry and releasing unfinished products to the public.",
,Awesome. The physics make sense and graphics areGreat.,

Holding down buildings from enemys or running across a open field and getting shot out of know where and hitting the deck and wondering what the hell to do. Great game and concept to the game. Fun if you have buddies. Also fun to team kill XD,

,NEEDS A MAP SELECT OPTION!,
,"This game is complete trash. Honestly I'm still wondering how the they actually thought this game was ""ready"" when it was ""offically"" released back in Dec 21 2017 with the 1.0 update. They are some scumbags honestly. Game keeps crashing frequently and it hasn't been all this way when I first brought the game back in March I believe. Now whenever I load into the game it takes forever and by the time it does load I'm at the end of the plane route whereas my teammates have already jump in some other area that I am half across the map from. Ever since the recent updates I feel like with every ""patch"" or update the game continues to progress in a poorly optimized setting for their game and it's really sad. The game has almost been fully released in almost a year now and it's still this ""Fix PUBG"" is a joke as of right now the recent ""fixes"" they put out only gets worse and worse for me. I really hope by the time they finshed with all the fixes they promised us in their Fixed PUBG website is true and they would continue to patch this game up but as of right now don't but this game until they fixed all the damn bugs desync and optimized this damn game. I only play this game because I have hope that this game could be the best it can be in the spam of 3 months of fixes from the devs.",
,Of course you should buy this game. It's Grand Theft Auto and it does what you want it to do. Singleplayer is just as fun as online play with a great story. Just a no brainer.***EDIT PLEASE RECONSIDER THIS REVIEW.***I was one of the multiple people banned after minimal gameplay time and absolutely no history of cheating. Don't buy this game. If a company is going to be so careless in how they handle their playerbase you should not invest 60 dollars in them. I have sent multiple tickets to support to see if i can get at the very least an EXPLANATION why I got banned but the only person that has bothered to respond was ING TREVOR. TREVOR. FROM STORY MODE. Don't waste your money. You'll just be banned.,
,This game is a great game. As many online games there are toxic people and there are people who arent great at the game. Dont let the toxicity ruin the game. It is very fun. There are some bugs but they fix them fairly quick. The devs are doing their best and thats what matters.,
,Can play this game for hours and hours without advancing the storyline. Just roaming around doing random things driving the car and side missions is entertaining in itself.,
,10/10 would miss that ball again.,
,Rough on the edges but seriously addicting.,
,Good game still has some lag issues now and again.,
,need improvemnts and game is awesome,
,This truly is an amazing game. The graphics are absolutely stunning and the mechanics are so well thought out and made. I have around 61 hours on the game but I've only had it for about a month and can only play on weekends. The community isn't as toxic as most people say. I have logged on to multiple servers as a naked and was given a base and multiple full gear sets. Some people are rude but I believe that that's the entire purpose of the game. It was made so people could survive and fight and not so everyone could sit around and gather resources. It just came out of early access and I know that the only place this game can go is straight to the top. Highly reccomend it. 9.5/10,
,Okay so this game is extremely fantastic and gets your heart pumping. HOWEVER once you get to high ranks the number of hackers is so terrible. There is a hacker in everygame and now you can even see it in the deathcam. I have had multiple times where someone would be scoped in on the ground and then snap to my head then killing me ruining my duos and solos. Not to mention I have qued into duos and squad and have gotten 2 people that spoke english in my whole time playing PUBG. Sometimes you will have lag and hit reg problems but those problems seem to be dwarfed by the hackers/cheaters. I want to love this game and I do love it but I can't recommend this game until they fix the major problem which imo is the cheaters. Only then can they start to fix the hit reg and lag issues that are present.,
,1.5 million for purchasing early is a lie..allow me to clarify if you want the FULL amount.it is a lie..you cannot get 1 million of it unless you PVP!!!!!...PVErs were only given 500k!!!!!....this is a total misrepresentation of what was to be when sold ...if developers/reps will lie this early then game isnt worth it,
,"I have a low amount of hours on this game but i don't think anyone should waste their hard earned TRAPPP money on this game. The servers are unreliable and the dev team isn't doing their job by optomizing the game. i have a GTX 1070 with 32 gigs of ram an SSD and a hyperthreaded 4 core processor. and this game still crashes.When a game making as much money as it does selling this game to 15 year olds trying to play with their friends they should really be looking to update their game before creating an e sports scene. The version of the game they use in the tournements are not the same as they are on the lvie game. I don't think a company the ""plays"" their players like that shouldn't be in business and certainly does not deserve your business.",
,Won't work on my mac (My processor is 2.5 Ghz Intel Core i5Memory 8GB 1600 Mhz DDR3and it's a macintosh HD ( please help?,
,This game can be quite fun however the fact remains that it is very survivor tailored. Being a killer is like trying to open the worlds toughest pickle jar with your toes. This new ranking system makes pipping incredibly hard for killers as it really hurts you in ways you really can't control. In fact it seems to reward you for camping a survivor which is not fun for either party. It is also worth noting that bugs are incredibly common and rarely fixed. When they are they've been in the game for quite awhile. I rather like this game but it's honestly not worth the time nor the money I invested in it. It's rather sad.,
,"Fun game but the introduction of paid keys for ""Desperado"" is a step in the wrong direction",

,Grand Theift Auto 5 is literally one of my favourite games when I want to kick back relax and blow stuff up. I have spent most of my time playing this using their online feature and it's great.

,pretty ing boring and the developer is a,
,I was looking forward to this game coming to pc and when its release was delayed to make sure it was perfect I was impressed with the choice the final product is terrible and extremely disappointing. It glitches controls are slow too many server errors for the time I have played. Though it does look great for a game I anticipated so much I am highly disappointed especially after the delay in release so it could be perfected.,
,wow much fun,
,I get stuck at the waiting for character screen (,
,This is a interesting game al tought the servers are colapse some times and causes have to play on far away severs. Also can be good new maps weaponsm and vehicules to upgrade the experience of the game.,
,This game is one of the best games i ever played.,
,Fast flying cars 10/10 cocket league. faster than my dad chasing me trying to beat me,
,Best game I ever bought in 2016! Should have done it earlier!,
,Mr X is too scary. bad game design,
,I'm just gonna go ahead and say that the game is great.The recent update on September 6th has solved the remainder of the connection issues that although didn't happen to me personally did plague many others. It also fixed the frame drops that occured during high intensity moments of Kushala or Teostra. With Deviljho being released and much more content to be available in the coming monthes I don't see why you shouldn't pick this game up.Don't bother with the mixed rating just a lot of babies who aren't updating their reviews along with Capcom's fixes. What I commonly see as reasons would be the 6 months wait and how they shouldn't of released the game if it wasn't finished yet. To be honest the released version of the game wasn't that bad. The hunts were fun and I'd much rather have access to the game as early as possible. I'm sure many others were excited and couldn't wait any longer as well.,
,car soccer.with rockets.,
,There is plenty of good reviews about this game.I enjoy it mostly the ICE rink mod. wish that was the main game as i find the ball touch too random for my taste.what i really hate about the game is matchmaking and joining games with 1 minute to go loosing 6 nul.just fix that all ready.,
,Product received for free. Really good game i would rate 11 10 best game i have played so far,
,the new updating has caused a serious bug which turns every words in to dots. and I am enable to read any of the context now. this is very annoying wish can have a instant update to solve this bug,
,nice game. very interesting,
,Great game addictive just remember to have fun (and you will) while getting to know the physics and controls. Can be frustrating at times. Still trying (and failing) like hell to fly and score an aerial goal. I highly recommend to play it with friends.10/10,
,Its good,
,Take Two,
,The Ultimate Experience!,
,This ia an awesome game where you basically put together the idea of soccer matches and undestroyable cars! Great game and really like itOne thing I would like to add is where people are more balanced like where pros are playing with Pros because MANY times I have lost a game due to a bad teammate!*November 2018 Update* I don't like the idea of the rocket pass because it is DEFINITLY copying Fortnite (not like that is a good game). Many devs have copied the idea of a Battle Royale and now Rocket league is too. This was such a fun game to play with before the rocket pass,
,The game is great! Still alot of things to work out but its understandable. Would love a few more maps ones that are smaller so there is the option of quicker rounds.,

,You spawn you see another naked you try to talk to them you get a rock hurled at your head.0/10 this game lost the social aspect which made it fun.,

,fun shoots.,
,RUSTIt has so many layers to it so where to begin.Well. I'm no writer so I'll try to keep it to the point.Typical negative stuff said about RUST Hackers haven't ever seen one. 587 hrs on record. Grind Sure. But there are tons of servers with x3/x5/x10 even x1000. You think it feel like a grind simply pick another server. Griefers Once again. Pick the right server with no griefs allowed. Griefed anyways pop a quick message to admin and they'll help you. If not then you're doubtfully on the right server. Lag Not really not anymore than the next game even though there has been some at late I haven't really noticed any since 2 updates ago. Only people who shoot on sight Simply not true. Alliances are made and RUST has somewhat of a self justice enviroment. Especially if you like to be part of the social aspect chat helping people ect. It's my clear opinion that jackasses often get's as deserved. It really is a living social world where you'll meet the same people many times which is why you'll know who's who form alliences build neighborhoods ect. If you are a lone wolf like playing solo well unless you're one of those Chuck Norris kind of guys unlearn that quick to survive ) Offline raiders Build better bases it's a big part of why I enjoy RUST. Trial and error baby learn from your mistakes. There is alot of different ways to keep those unwanted visitors out and I personally love to see how raiders have to give up. I don't understand why people get so upset over raiders. They are doing you a service by testing out your design... for free and they use plenty of ressources to do it. Unless ofc they find your lootroom..What else.. What do I don't like?All of above still jazz,
,I really hate to give this game a bad rep based on something not game related but I feel compelled to warn those thinking of purchasing and losing $60.00. I bought this game after it came out for PC as an upgrade from my PS3 version. Graphics are crisp and beautiful the story is excellent with tons of extras after you finish the main storyline. My problem is with the Rockstar Social Club and their TERRIBLE service. They will not respond to countless emails I have sent to them about how their Social Club launcher will not let me play my game if this was one of the cheaper less new games I probably would not be so passionate about this but for this I feel completely jipped and ripped off. My experience with Rockstar has been one with months of not being able to play the game I spent a lot of money on and after this awful experience I will more than likely be searching for other games to spend my little amount of time one. Social Club is complete garbage and I'm shocked that such a well respected company treats their customers in this manner. Will more than likely not be purchasing another Rockstar product that I cannot even play.,
,vroom vroom s,
,The amount of angry entitled losers who keep tanking the games rating is a sorry example of the state of gaming today. You'd think the developers had publicly killed a puppy the way people are reacting instead of adding purely optional and purely cosmetic micro transactions. The game is fun zany and due to the amount of players and the way that it's structured you never know what's going to happen. I highly recommend this game. The new first person servers are definetly my favourite though. Third person too strongly favours camping.,
,New hunter or old hunter please give it a try. I started MH series with PSP then with 2DS. One thing i need to sat about MHW is that i can finally play on my PC.,

,Worst game i ever pl ayed,
,Just not a friendly specs game for mid end PC user like me. Please make more comforable in 4GB users.,
,Everything what Rockstar wants is money unfortunately. And they recently shut down OpenIV so... Really bad approach for so big company.,
,The gameplay felt old and rusty,
,Feel like this is to early to write a review but the 9 hours I have played it have been amazing and I feel comfortable writing one. First off if you don't have this game go ahead and get it because I'm just going to be writing about how amazing it is and you'll waste your time so just get it. Now Rocket League despite what a lot of people are saying this game is not fifa with cars in any way. This game is its own game there is no passing period. If you expect everyone to be in order and stick to actual soccer positions you will unterly fail because this game is chaos and the object is to get the ball into the other teams goal and keep the ball out of yours. There really is no teamwork but if you want to succeed you have to use it but most players I've played with did not use a mic did not set up other players and did not play as the goalie. So if you want a fifa experience don't play this. This is not fifa with cars it just isn't but what it is an extremely fast paced game where you use hot wheels type cars to score goals and to defend and you can do both with mutiple different acrobatics. Every movement in this game will make you feel like a bad whether its boosting all the way down the field after a power up or diving in front of a ball and flip kicking it out of the way you will love every second of the movement and the thousands of players playing it can promise that. The way you become the best at this game is to think around the chaos look for the openings and most importantly have fun because if you beat yourself up over one missed shot it will affect your game tremendously. So get this game and when you do have funEric,

,optimize the game already lmao,
,Literally had to change my rating for this game. I was very supportive for PUBG. I gave it a chance and I also gave Fortnite a chance. But after seeing and reading about PUBG sueing Fortnite again for 'copyrighting'. I just have to give this game a super negative review. It's absolutely ridiculously that they re doing what they re doing. Fortnite got their games under control. I don t have a single hiccup. But after days and days for weeks to months. I still have optimization problems cheating problems and just problems after problems with this game. Don t forget about the stupid loot boxes where you have the buy every keys for every boxes. The customizing is unappealing. It s so dull and just plain out boring. PUBG is like the now of DC and Fortnite s the Marvel. Stop suing other companies when you re NOT original. Focus more of your damn game. Fix the bugs and bugs and bugs! FIX IT! Stop being an immature baby stand the heck up and fix the darn thing. Geez,

,I'm sure everyone is mostly concerned about the optimization and that's understandable. But PLEASE make the motorcycles less y than they are. As in make them more stable than being able to do a Triple 360* Backflip from a 1ft elevated mount of dirt.On a side note if you could make it so that the gun is armed when the magazine is IN the gun and not when the reload animation is finished that would be a small but fantastic update.,

Very few animals and they can kill you easily if you don t have ranged weapon. You can t even hide in house. They will walk through walls!. Don t want to spend time on crafting? Okay kill everyone then. That s all you can do in this game. Kill or build. Same boring locations envious helicopter pilot that will kill you if you have something better than rock in your inventory.

,I would defo recommend this game its fun and thrilling at the same time the self satisfactions of building your own base and defending it is amazing sometimes the game can loose its sense of fun but it will soon come back if anyone wants a cheapish game that is being updated constantly then i would recommend rust it has its problems but they will soon be fixed.,

,I picked this gem up shortly after release. I had no idea there was a predecessor on Playstation 3 Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars. This game is absolutely ridiculous. So ridiculous it has caused me to neglect many other games I have impulsively picked up during Steam sales. This game has been such a problem that I have put in over whopping 400 hours. That is just nuts over 16 days of gaming. In all honesty I love this game. All the various cars you can choose from and all the many possible customization options are dope. This review is way late and the latest update is the Aquadome and crate system. All just awesome. My only gripe is the fact I do not like that the crate keys are about a buck a piece and that you can often get repeat items out of the crates. If there are just a small group of people to play with trading becomes hard and crates build up due to the fact I cannot justify spending money constantly to open items that I will most likely already have. In my honest opinion I believe each key should be about 25 cents with a minimum four pack being a dollar. Just pick it up and play. It is fun. I currently game with an XBone One Elite Controller and use two paddles on the back for ball view and drifting/sliding. Pretty rad.,
,Excellent Game... More fun ( in SQUADS ) if you have friends... (Moreover it's an extremely realistic game !,
,Rocket league is a simple yet dynamic game for all skill levels. Starting out as a rookie you will rise through ranks and playstyles alike. Where new players will have great fun in learning the elemental controls and hitting the ball where it hurts more advanced players will want to start testing the merits of flying. Having conquered these at an elementary level the fun starts for real. There's really no limit to the amount of idiotic tenuously difficult flying actions you can perform. And oh imagine the joy of leaving your opponents dumbfolded in sight of your absurdly awesome goals!,

,I LAIK DIS GAME FOR REALLL GAIISSSS.. 10/10,
,not fun. straight up. why do people play this game?????,
,With over 100 hours in the game I can now say I'm sad about the state of this game. When I purchased this game it was early access and we waited forever for the one update to hopefully fix the insanely poor buggy game. The game is fun and its a insane to actually win . But the combat works better with close quater combat rather than the games constantly wanting long range. Most of the guns you will find are close quarters with a splattering of long range guns (good luck finding a scope to use said rifle once you find it). Then we are lead into the cheaters and poor optimized game. At the current moment most cheaters are seeming to come from china and the developer refuses to give china their own region locked server even though that would solve and Unknown himself calls the players asking for that xenophopic for even suggesting it. The developer seems to priotize how the game looks rather than make the game not run like even with a rig with more than enough power to run it. Please fix the game. It can be fun. Please focus on the bugs and the preformance. Listen to the community on this one because we have a point sometimes.,

,This is a HEAVILY chopped down review if you want my full thoughts click here https //www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/3cqffc/an_in_depth_grand_theft_auto_v_reviewrant/After over 300 hours of gameplay. I think I can give this beast a proper review. Since IV is my beloved in the franchise and the previous major installment a lot of my comparisons will be between the gameplay of GTA IV and GTA V. Is that biased? Very. So take this with a grain of salt from a IV fanboy.GTA V is a great sandbox game but when you compare it to the previous iterations of the GTA franchise it feels as if something was left behind. There s so much to cover in this game I think I ll go bullet point by bullet point in order to better organise my ramblings. I will be covering the three core gameplay mechanics of every GTA game. Driving combat and story. I will also be talking about the multiplayer since that was where a majority of my time was spent.(If you want a quick summery skip to the bottom of this review) DRIVING At the core of every GTA game is surprise driving. And man does GTA V really improve on driving. Cars have much better handling compared to IV Vice City and SA. GTA IV always had slippery cars that took quite a while to learn. GTA V improves upon this with better breaking tighter controls and more realistic handling. There s even some nice attention to detail when it comes to driving. Car statistics double clutch acceleration working internal gauges fuel that drains if the gas can is breached and more. The driving has improved so much there are racing crews and communities within the game. So hats off to you Rockstar.However a lot of their statistics are hidden in the game s code. The game records four vague stats about every vehicle in the game. Top speed Acceleration Braking and Handling. These stats are completely not indicative of the real performance of cars since there s so much more going on under the hood and some stats flat out lie. For instance the Bravado Gauntlet muscle car completely beats the Vapid Dominator in terms of stats having significantly better Speed and Acceleration. Yet the Vapid Dominator is one of the best muscle cars in the game. Why? Because the stats don t take into consideration torque wheel traction weight durability oversteer and understeer horsepower and so much more. COMBAT Combat in GTA V sucks plain and simple. So if you don t want to hear me whine about it feel free to skip ahead to the story and mark that as my opinion. GTA has always had clumsy melee systems but at least IV s system was functional albeit awkward. This however is a joke. If you go bare knuckle against someone you re in for one hell of a time. When you fight you spastically flail your fists and legs at the other person like you ve just taken muscle relaxers or suffer from spinal paralysis. You will brawl like none of the characters has ever clenched a fist before until someone falls down dead. For the controls there s a button specifically for your kicks however pressing the attack button (which there are two of that do the same attacks) will randomly intermix some of these weak shoves into your combo . Blocking is only really effective for using counters which is the only consistent way to look like you know what you re doing while knocking someone down. Guns are disappointing to say the least. Rockstar games aside from Max Payne 3 have always had good but not fantastic gunplay. The guns sound awful one even sounds less threatening than my airsoft gun. Fire rates on pistols and automatic weapons are also terrible. Pistols fire once every half second and the AK fires about as fast as a Civil War gatling gun. I must give props to the detailed animation work that went into reloading and firing but that cannot forgive the horrible feel of the weapons. Not only the the guns limp to fire but shooting someone is equally disappointing. In GTA V when you shoot almost anyone they immediately flop to the ground like a dead fish sporting almost no animation. In actuality they have a lot more health left so half of the gunplay is you shooting at bodies already on the ground trying to finish them off.Health is another major issue that GTA V has. GTA V switches all of this up for the worst. Your health regenerates slowly if you are standing still in cover or driving up to half of your health bar. Let s just take a moment to absorb how annoying that is. I can understand regenerating fully or regenerating a little so you don t die an embarrassing death to stubbing your toe but half? On top of this you die. Fast. And to make matters worse enemies are deadly accurate. All enemies with all weapons in all situation. I cannot tell you how many times I have been hit from an untrained two bit thug blind firing a pistol with one hand from several meters away. If you thought random shotgun cops in GTA IV was bad imagine that as the entire combat experience. STORY GTA V takes a bold step in a new direction by introducing three unique characters at the same time that you can freely switch between. This is quite a cool idea but unfortunately none of them are quite as memorable because of it. Michael is bitter Franklin is fed up and Trevor is crazy. I want to love these characters so much more than I do since the actors give such great performances and the writing is spot on. But splitting the story among three characters while keeping the game length the same means they re much more shallow. The connections between the main and side characters are less significant and as a whole our protagonists feel like the one dimensional pieces of a better character. Michael is the most relatable character among the three having a family you interact with frequently. His backstory is fleshed out the most having history and revealing that he did things to get out of his life of crime for his family. Franklin might as well not exist in the story. He s a pawn throughout the entire thing following the orders of someone else and never taking things into his own hands. He really could have been replaced by anyone. Hell Lamar is a significantly more interesting character because he did dumb things on his own. Not to mention having hilarious writing. I guess Franklin is supposed to be the player more of a blank slate that you can identify with. Trevor good god Trevor. Trevor got the best writing the best performance the zaniest missions the most unique characteristics and does everything for himself. But he s a bit too much he doesn t really have a side you can identify with as human. In fact the game goes out of the way by making him feel entirely inhuman. When we re introduced to him he confronts and kills a character that you played as in a previous GTA game. I was this character I learned about him fought through his struggles and came to love him. Seeing Trevor kill him without any sort of ceremony sucked. It hampered my ability to love Trevor. CONCLUSION I ve enjoyed my time in GTA V. Don t get me wrong despite my griping it s a fun open world sandbox and it s done well. But after dealing with it s major to minor issues for 300+ hours I ve had enough. This is where GTA V and I depart. Overall I cannot recommend this game. I felt like I ve had more of a negative experience coming out of this game than coming in. There s so much more I could talk about but I ve already outstayed my welcome and probably off a few people along the way. This rambling wasn t to complain about a product or on people who enjoy it but rather to show people that it isn t a groundbreaking flawless game like the Metacritic score may suggest. It has its faults some rather large ones and GTA V doesn t do anything better than previous installments can do. Which is why this gets my thumbs down.,
,Great game (y) !!,
,Rust is a game about surviving you can survive agains the animals and other hazards like players or die trying. This game a sureal feel to it so i reccomend playing in the dark have fun and good luck!,
,I can't even play it. It just gives me a black window when I try to launch it.,
,"""Hey you know what I haven't played rocket league in a couple of days yeh let's go play it! And... try hard try hard everywhere oh they called me a and gay cause I'm bad...ok time to play counter strike global offensive. 4/7",
,Pretty good game if you have friends or want to solo it.,
,a nice game to play with friends,
,battlegrounds is a good fantastic battle and the feels you get are so real it feels like your in the game.I love this game and im really bad but every now and then i get that kill.now im going to say how good it looks 10/10 its really pretty.monthly updates this game is a good standpoint for what an early access game should be like. every now and then you get the glitchy plane lobby and around areas but still its in early access and its just going to get better.if you are chosing if you should buy it i say yes. my overall rating 8/10 because of the glitchs low frame rate and little things that could put this up to a 9.5/10,
,...the absolute dregs of humanity coming together to ruin the lives of every man woman and child they come across. Basically the virtual embodiment of my home town.10/10 would bring back painful memories of childhood again,
,a awesome game i love the series i recommend this game to anyone who loves hunting and crafting games.,
,"Pros Addictive as hell. Often find myself saying ""Just one more game"" Finding/joining games is fast and easy. Usually join a 100 person server under a minute. The ever collapsing ring of play keeps action focused and fast paced. Cons Servers can be *very* laggy sometimes to the point where you teleport in one place and can't move anywhere. Related to latency sometimes you can't pick up items/enter vehicles reliably. Since this is early access the game engine isn't fully optimized so FPS stays in the 60's even on lower settings. Still this game is fun as hell and gets you into the action fast.",
,Fire.,
,overrated survival gameget it if you're a kid that has nothing better to do than play video games,
,Just cant get enough of this game. Cant wait to see what the developers have in stall for the full release.,
,Good game (as is) with a promising developmental future.,
,my competer can't load the game,
,Best game ever? Best game ever.,
,GG pubg said FIX network problem?? !! new update and pkt loss!!!!,
,Game was great until recently now it is literally unplayable due to this hacker situation they say they are doing something about it yet they refuse to ban these people and refuse to region lock them just becasue some of them might not be hacking. meanwhile they let those who are run rampant unless you are going to hack as well i would not recomend this game because there is no way you will get anywhere near the top ten let alone win,
,Great game! Endless amounts of fun supports cross platform plays well as a competitive and casual multiplayer and is fun for just about all ages. Can't get enough!,
,Took all my in game money even though I never used a hack or cheated at any time. but still was worth it i can't say this game wasn't a blast so thumbs up despite it all.,
,This game was fun. But without region locking there is more asians then americans on the North american servers. They ping high causing They cheat and you cannot find english speaking teammates. I cant even get a refund this is trash.,
,Great game Lots of fun Fashion! Very addicting,
,Update November 2018 Although this game is still far from polished it has come a long way since Early Access. It has a good mix of MilSim action and Battle Royale adrenaline. Some terrain (boulders and rocks in particular) could use hitbox updating Erangel could use some loot buffs and I would like to see pistols buffed but these are minor complaints. The gameplay is still solid and I keep coming back to this game!(It is also possible I wrote this review to get a badge but don't let that stop you from trying out the game),
,"1) Over zealous monitization of a full price game...go yourself2) Poor optimization with rampant desync3) Large population of cheaters (13 million banned...like it matters with an VPN you fcktards)4) PUGs in duos or squad consist of 90% Chinese who don't speak English5) I used to love this game but holy sheet it isn't beta anymore so WTF is up with the sad state of this game?6) Worth about $10.00 wait for a sale when this turd begins to circle the bowl.7) Region lock?8) 19/20 DUO games ""where are you from?""

,The game is filled with modders from time to time Rockstar doesn't care.,
,This game marks the biggest leap forward that Monster Hunter ever did. During the first half of the game the gameplay will be easy to pick up for newcomer while the second half is challenging it does everything right to bring new players and veteran together.,

Until it's not too late....,
,Alot of fun if you can find food within the first 5 minutes of playing. Some bugs and glitches but nothing that makes it unplayable but this game would be much better if it had a singleplayer which I hope is coming soonGame Rating 6.8 7,

,Scorpion Kick Simulator 201510/10 would boost jump again Actual Review Alright. I'll be honest. I got this game because of the immense hype surrounding it. And OH MY LORD JESUS CHRIST get it. Now. Among the top 5 purchases I've made. Worth every cent. This game deserves your firstborn. This game is addicting extremely fun and best with friends (dont worry its still fun when solo). Psyonix did well. Game looks very nice as well but thats just icing on the cake. The physics are amazing the community is awesome... Where's the con list? Oh there's none... except the servers sometimes but the devs are really supporting the games servers now.Just get the game. Join the craze. C'mon it's football/soccer with nitro cars. What's not to like?,
,"Product received for free. To summarize my experience with this game so far is that I am dissappointed with the mod aspect from without starting the game yet. It prompts you to go into Bethesda.net to log in there Would be fine if you have an account otherwise prepare for the most fustrating experience of your life.My tale began innocently enough recently I just downloaded this since I have the old skyrim. So free game is free and I like free. But after downloading it and setting up my graphic settings. I was curious on to mods. I was sadden when I saw that the steam community didn't have mods for the Special Edition. And Then things went downhill after that. I saw they had Bethesda.net and wanted you to log into there. So naturally I go to the site and try to create an account since I don't have one. Well it asked for a fairly simple request with usernames. But every username that is fairly unique to me was some how ""unavailable"" aka taken. I spent a solid 30 minutes trying to come up with any username before i just gave up on that notion. I seriously would say that if you are going to get this game for the modding community don't bother. Go with the old skyrim that one is much easier to deal with and you can find mods on nexus or workshop there that is much easier to get to. Otherthan that? my impressions is the gameplay should be fine for vanilla and I will be testing that out.",
,its like the extra fun version of fifa for pc that never was,
,trash game,
,Spend money on crates for decals lol,
,NO MODS 9/11 IGN!,
,This is a very hard good game that you can have hours of fun playing.,
,Good game but just fix the lagg D,
,Honestly in my opinion worth every penny. my first game period. i will not forget everything great about this game But on the other hand you will die a lot there is a steep learning curve and you will not regret the purchase,
,Really bad game,
,I spawned not sure on what I was doing...went to a bush and a black man ran at me with a rock! Wasn't sure what to do so i ended up having a naked fight with a black man and a massive !Only issue is the game randomly shuts off after a while and I had jus found my house after dying!!!,
,This is a must have for every PC gamer.Tons and tons of free DLC and more to come.,
,Nice Game for premade!!!,
,I like this game but i have one issues in this game i have missing textures in this game if you know how to fix that add me!,
,Fun game. There is no game without bugs/cheats but overall is worth it.,
,Freddy sucks,
,A lot of hackers/modders in this game. The multiplayer is still super buggy. Overall a pretty good game though.,
,cant even play most the time because of network lag issues. wont play again until these issuses are fixed. fun game when it actually works,
,This is a very enjoyable game. Most of the mechanics are straight forward and exactly how you would image them to be in a game like this. Therefore you can jump right in and start having fun without too much of a learning curve. The game is extremely tactical and a small decision at the beginning of your match could mean death later on. This game thrives when playing in a squad with your friends.Update patches are regular (usually once a week) with hot fixes being deployed right away when needed. I look forward to following this game as it develops.,
,this game has more problems then any game in history and needs way to much work it may be in early access but it is so early and bad then when i am playing i feel like im beta testing before the game even hits the market. Bottom line you should get paid to play this game not pay to play this game.,
,Very worth game,
,"10/10 All my friends now know that ""F"" Honks the horn.",
,This is a awesome game after buying it i cant stop playing it. Especially online. But the servers are a bit crap. They sometimes stop for no reason and everybody leaves. adn this happens even when i am in a heist. otherwise its a good game,
,Amazing game. 2v2 &lt 3 vroom vroom,
,9/10 Have a blast freeroaming through SAN ANDREAS!,
,Product received for free. Nice game !,
,Wish I didn't buy this game it's fun at first then gets boring very fast if you sit in a building and play safe the entire time it's an easy win Most servers have insane Lag gotta pick up ammo 4 times and then load your gun 3 times overall it's not worth buying because you will quickly get bored of Tyler Perry's battlegrounds aka a ing joke of a game,
,unless your pc/laptop is optimised to play triple A games you gotta run this thing on lowest setting to get a decent fps granted is early access so you will be expecting lags bugs server connection errors battle F**king eye wont let you start the game and oh yer we have paid cosmetics now so thats cool but wait you had this on recommend? alright anyone who has a heart problem dont bother because is the last ten scenario we camp and fight for when your heart is pumping over 200 bpm and your hands is already stink with sweat atlast you get that long awaited chicken dinner and you feel..... empty so you decided to go outside and get that three piece box from kfc for 12.99 with a stamdard drink.(paid sponsor by KFC Australia),
,I loved playing this before the social justice update but... Now I see people complaining about bad performance from updates too? None of my friends are playing with it in this condition. This a n t iharrassment system that enables more of what it is trying to prevent is stupid and shouldn't exist. Online Bans are supposed to be for foulplay cheaters and hackers not for protecting your safe space. For unsportsman like play or chat griefing I feel if it is actually the programmers responsibility to protect you from negative online interactions to that extent it should only be through utilities like individualized blocklists or blacklisted matchmaking servers for rude uncooperative or frequent afk players to play amongst themselves. It's unreasonable to revoke service without breaking any agreed terms and I did not see my fellow players permanent happy mentality in the ToS. I literally haven't played ANY randoms or used any crate keys since they added bans because I feel anxious that BS would happen to me. Simply because matchmaking is such random unbalanced crap unfair games are not fun and leave children salty and report happy.. If that happens to me I will likely never play again period. In the mean time I feel better leaving it alone permanently of my own volition and only playing IF friends I know who won't do that EVER play again. So far no luck..,
,It is a very good game. But it isnt recomended for people that rages a lot and quickly gets mad. Very fun btw,
,I bought this for the mods and now I can't even get mods on it anymore?? Erm?,
,Not good enough guys. The kids wanna mod. 354/10 for customer service,
,Great Game10/10 Just don't waste your money on shark cards,
,Always a blast to play either alone or with a group of friends!,
,The game runs poorly low fps much lags low fun .Dont buy yet maybe in a few months...If they can fix the performance issues this could be a real fun game though!,
,Haven't been outside in years cuz of this game.,
,"Game has cosmetics that have worse odds of unlocking then winning the lottery. On top of this the community has made several suggestions few of which have been implemented. It fees like the devs stopped caring because they got popular and started making alot of money. This game in the end is only slightly better then fortnite and that says ALOT considering how that cesspool of a ""game"" is.",
,This game became cs go now you have to buy skins or don't play it.. Try mobile version if you really like the idea of pubg,
,Pretty much decent,
,Take two (owns rockstar) RUINED the online experience by ruining the game economy. I shouldnt have to spend an extra $100 on top of a $60 game to enjoy only very little of the online content. This isnt CSGO where youre only paying for skins. For gta its pay to play then you just pay and pay moreTLDR unless you're bill gates dont buy this,
,Good game. First of many BR games and still one of the best.,
,Product received for free. Nice Game,
,Product received for free. Really good game addictive. Although the match is 5min you can spend hours in the game.,
,love this game but hackers are everywhere. and please region lock china,
,Great game great single player. Problem is the ompany that owns it is money grubbing and exploitative with microtransactions in multiplayer and possibly even getting rid of modding.Good for a mobile game i suppose.,
,i love dead by daylight its a fun horror game where you can either play as a survivor and escape the grasp of the killer or you can be the killer and run around grab survivors and then hook them. Loved It 10/10,
,A great game that you don't easily get bored ofPros +Incredibly fun.+Lots of cars and customization options to choose from.+Many modes.+Great singleplayer.+Good graphics.+Easy to play.+Lots of UpdatesCons +Some issues related to internet and ping but that's only in my area.+Can't play with a specific player on another platform unless you create a private match.Overall a truly amazing game and definately worth your money.9/10,

,I think the game is allrigth but there are some things like hitboxes blocking the bullet or guns doing very low damage. Also soundworld could need some fixes...,
,A fun game if you like survival and pvp + pve if you want on servers. Its very fun if you have people to play with and the servers are fun too i guess... Get it for survival in a harsh enviroment with good elements 8/10. Nudity is involved but can be turned off,
,Honestly endless hours of fun. Never seems to get boring because the map is really big and the people aren't too difficult. Once you get all the controls settled down it is a really fun and addicting game,
,Amazing! love this game and I have made so many new friends from it!DEFINITLY GET THIS GAME!!! #$%!!,
,Overall the game is good I love the unique concept about it. it's a battle royale yes. But still there's something different about it than H1Z1 ARMA 3. Also fun to play in squads and duos.Got a custom match system that anyone can use.Now for the bad stuff PThe game is very poorly optimized most people don't get more than 45 50 FPS on regular areas.The loot system is ed up you can go inside 5 houses and barely get a pistol and backpack. Also the servers seem to be unstable and have constant lags.,
,Run around with naked people. What's not to like ??,

,I recommend this game but this servers are crap.Fix this bugs and PUT MORE SERVERS PLZ,

,I'd say this game is good but as all games it has its downsides. The games servers are not the best in the world and will probably screw you over every once in a while but overall a good game.,

,Amazing game straight up. I only am writing this review for the first time to the disagreement of the other reviews having problems with it so far.I don't know what's up with their internet or PC but the game works fine. Not Perfect because Yes even I had trouble coming to the Error 50382 MW1 but I assure you it does work if you put just a tad bit effort in like creating a new session or whatever.This is by no means a bad game because It's Monster Hunter that originally was supposed to played on PS4 not PCI don't know if you truly expected a PC Port to be 100% Perfect from a company that already puts so much effort into a beloved series and has NEVER done a PC release like this. I'm completely baffled by the amount of ignorance and hatred it gets that gets sent because of it.Give it time and it will work. There will be hiccups sure. But it has worked for me. They've never placed Monster Hunter on a PC so you gotta give em respect for atleast trying to do their research hence the long 7 months it took for it to release. And I have never lost faith in a Monster Hunter game. It's my all time favorite Series since Freedom Unite and I HIGHLY recommend this game to you and friends.Seriously if a friend can play it and connect to sessions on a potato of a laptop and internet. I'm very sure there's not much excuse here. All I'm asking is that you can wait a bit longer or play the game cause it deserves to be played and respected as a GOOD game.,
